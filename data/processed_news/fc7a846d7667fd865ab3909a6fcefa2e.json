Beautiful, playful, discerning, and endlessly curious, cats are wonderful companions. Like Charles Dickens said, “What greater gift than the love of a cat?” My family is all cat people, but my youngest daughter is positively obsessed, and we have bought more than our fair share of the best gifts for cat lovers. When I searched “cat” in my Amazon orders, there were nine pages of results. While most of these cat-related gifts are for humans, I’ll throw in a few gifts for cats. Though, in my experience, cats love nothing more than empty boxes. We also have guides to fancy cat furniture , automatic cat feeders , automatic cat litter boxes , and our favorite cat toys and supplies . Updated April 2025: We've added cat bowls, an automatic litter tray, feeder, and cat fountain, and updated prices. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Mug BigNoseDeer Kawaii Cat Mug This thick ceramic cat-themed mug is the perfect choice for hot chocolate, and my daughter has been using hers for a few years now. It has a wee wooden lid with a cat head handle to keep the contents warm, there’s a gap for the included cat paw spoon, and it comes with a cat-head cork coaster. There’s even a removable fish-shaped tea infuser, though we’ve never used it. This mug is microwave- and dishwasher-safe. $14 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Alternative Cat Tree Happy & Polly Gothic Cat Tree with Coffin Bed There are tons of fluffy beige cat trees, but what if your style and tastes are a little darker? This three-tier cat tree from Happy & Polly has two coffin bed platforms, a removable and washable sleeping spot up top, sisal rope-covered scratching posts and dangling bats. It is the perfect cat tree for goths and folks into spooky stuff. $110 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Cards Exploding Kittens This card game is easy to pick up, but you must play smart to avoid exploding kitten cards. It is fun but also complex enough to suck everyone in. Many of the featured cats are cute, some are not so cute, but they often have special powers that let you gain an edge over your opponents. There are tons of expansions to change things up when it gets too familiar. You can find more ideas, including a couple of other cat-themed options, in our best family board games guide. $20 at Amazon $20 at Target Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Hair Catcher ChomChom  Roller Pet Hair Remover One of the downsides of sharing your home with cats, especially long-haired cats, is that they shed constantly. Our ragdoll leaves long white hairs on everything, so a roller to run over the rugs and couches and pick up the hair is essential. Even some of the best vacuums struggle to lift pet hair, but this simple roller is very effective. $28 $25 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Squishy Cat Vintoys Sleeping Cat Hugging Pillow My daughter has enough teddies and plushies to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool, but “squishy cat” has always been her favorite. This super soft pillow is the most huggable thing ever, even if it has gotten tatty and paint-stained. We have bought a few over the years to give as gifts, and anyone who ever cuddles up with one of these cats falls in love. $24 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cats for Crocs Cat Shoe Charms Trick out your Crocs with these super cute cat charms. They slot easily into the holes of any pair of Crocs and are made from nontoxic, waterproof PVC material. These cat charms are a great way to transform ugly shoes, and my daughter loves them. $9 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Cushion Ditucu Cat Paw Cushion Whether you want to make a chair comfier or provide a sleeping spot for your feline friend, this cat-paw-shaped cushion is perfect. It’s large, it’s soft, it’s everything you want in a cushion. My daughter’s cat Rocket sleeps on this at the end of her bed most nights. $27 at Amazon Photograph: Molly Higgins Automatic Litter Box Whisker Litter-Robot 4 Fishing smelly nuggets out of a litter tray with a wee plastic scoop is the worst part of living with cats. If you want to treat the cat lover in your life, removing this awful task is a wonderful gift. As the “Rolls-Royce” of the best automatic litter boxes , the Whisker Litter-Robot 4 safely and efficiently sifts away your cat’s deposits and any lingering smells into an easily disposable bag in a drawer in the bottom. It can also track their toilet trips and weight and act as an early warning signal for illness. $699 at Litter-Robot $699 at Best Buy $799 at Amazon (Bundle) $699 at Chewy Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Stickers Cute Cat Stickers Kids love stickers. Some adults will love these cat stickers, too. These impossibly cute vinyl cat stickers are perfect for decorating bedrooms, laptops, water bottles, and whatever else needs a touch of cat-shaped cutening. $7 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Feline Flask Puckator Pusheen Insulated Bottle This stainless steel water bottle has lasted my daughter for years and has a handy LED temperature display on the lid, though the design is partially worn away now. It is an insulated flask that can keep cold drinks cool for up to 24 hours or keep hot drinks warm for up to six hours. It holds 450 milliliters. Sadly, it only seems to be available in the UK. I can’t find the same model stateside, so I have linked a different Puckator Pusheen insulated bottle for folks in the US, though it lacks the temperature display. $25 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Earbuds Holders Dancing Cats Pen Holder Trying to get these cats to hold a pen is a balance test, but they make incredibly cute desk ornaments. They can hold pens, earbuds, or whatever other small items you can balance on there. But, mostly, they just look fun. $20 $19 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Cam Enabot EBO ROLA Mini 2K Camera Robot A remote control camera on wheels that you can attach a dangly toy to makes for a lot of feline fun. The EBO ROLA can also play various annoying sounds, or you can talk through it, and it’s a nice way to check in and play with your cats when you are away from home. Sadly, though you can automate some sounds, this model doesn’t patrol or play by itself. But it can automatically record when there’s movement, and ours captured some hilarious videos of our three cats, who were unaware we were watching. $159 $140 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Laundry Hamper VK Living Cat Storage Basket This giant rope basket has a cat’s face, and the ears double as handles. It’s ideal for some extra storage in a kid’s bedroom, whether you want a place for plushies or toys. It could also serve as a laundry hamper for clothes or a basket for clean towels. $29 $25 at Amazon Photograph: Molly Higgins Automatic Feeder Petlibro Granary Smart Camera Feeder Loud meowing, ear nibbling, tearing up the carpet, walking up and down my body, and spilling a glass of water on the bed: These are all ways my delightful cats have woken me to inquire politely if it might be time to break their fast. If you feel like maybe 5 am is a tiny bit early to get up, you might benefit from an automatic feeder that can be scheduled, and the Petlibro Granary Smart Camera Feeder is the best. It even has a camera and two-way audio. If you need a wet food feeder or want more options, check out our best automatic cat feeders guide. $160 $106 at Amazon $140 at Chewy $140 at Petlibro Photograph: Simon Hill Kitty Cans Uncommon Goods Cats on Cats Glasses These beer-can-shaped cat glasses have a fun color cat illustration on the outside depicting a clowder of cats in different shades. Each glass holds 16 ounces and comes in a set of two made in Colorado. Sadly, they are not dishwasher- or microwave-safe, but they are irresistibly cute. $34 at Uncommon Goods Photograph: Simon Hill Cozy Toes Cliont Cat Slippers Keep your toes cozy with these cat slippers. They have an open heel, making them easy to slip on, plus a thick sole with a grippy, rubberized underside, and they are plush and warm inside. The cute cat design is the real reason to buy them, but they have lasted reasonably well. $15 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Laptop WHAT DO YOU MEME? ScratchPad Pro If you don’t want your carpets and furniture scratched to bits, you must provide plenty of scratching posts and pads for your cat’s claws. This comical laptop opens to reveal a video call with loads of cat pals, but there’s also a cardboard scratch pad, a ball tucked into a channel, and a mouse attached with an elastic cord. It’s kinda pricey for what it is, but our cat Luna loves it, and it always gets a laugh from visitors. $24 $18 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Drink Markers Genuine Fred Genuine Fred Wine Lives Kitty Drink Markers Is that my wine? If you’re fed up with trying to keep track of your glass at parties, these silicone cat markers curl around the stem of a wine glass and come in six colors, so you can easily tell whose is whose. They can also sit on a lip, and we find them handy for the kids' drinks, too, as they refuse to drink from any glass the other might have used. $20 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Socks Cavertin Cat Socks You can find many, many cat-themed novelty socks. What makes this pair from Cavertin worth a look is the writing on the soles that says, “I can’t get up right now, the cat is on my lap.” Since this is our daughter’s standard excuse for treating us like servers at a restaurant, we had to snag her a pair. Turns out they are lovely socks. $20 $10 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Jewelry Holder Lependor Ring Holder Jewelry Dish A wee dish is handy for keeping your everyday jewelry safe, and this cat dish includes a cat in the middle with a long tail that’s perfect for holding rings. My daughter uses it for scrunchies, hair ties, clips, rings, and necklaces. $10 at Amazon Photograph: Molly Higgins Water Fountain Petlibro Dockstream Fountain Cats may enjoy drinking milk, but whoever cleans their litter tray will not. Seriously, it’s bad for them. What they need, especially if they eat dry food, is a steady supply of fresh water, and a cat fountain with a filter is the perfect way to keep them hydrated. The best cat water fountains remove impurities and warn you when they are running low or the filter needs to be changed. Our top pick, the Petlibro Dockstream Fountain, does all that and more. $68 at Amazon $50 at Petlibro $85 at Petsmart Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Sign Kitty Biscuits Kitchen Sign Cats love to make biscuits. If you’re unfamiliar, cats will often push and pull with their two front paws on laps, cushions, or wherever they are about to nap, and it looks like they are kneading dough. This sign jokes about it with a cat baker pictured. Many folks believe this is an instinctual habit from when they were tiny and had to stimulate milk secretion from their mothers, but we don’t really know for sure. $10 at Amazon Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Cozy Oodie Gray Cat You'll have never been cozier or comfier than in one of these oversized hoodies with fleece exteriors and a fleecy sherpa lining inside. There’s also a hood and a giant front pocket, and you can curl up inside your hoodie because there’s bags of room. Oodies are the perfect winter companion, and my daughter adores the gray cat design on hers. You can get the same design as a robe ($59) if you prefer. Oodie also offers an oversize sleep T-shirt ($59) with a cute black kitty design made from super soft, stretchy bamboo fabric. $75 at Oodie Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Dish Uncommon Goods Happy Cat Spoon Rest When you're cooking or making hot drinks, a dedicated resting spot for your spoons is handy, and this colorful cat dish is perfect for the job. Crafted from earthenware clay and hand painted in Massachusetts, these dishes make a lovely wee gift. You can go for a black cat, but we prefer the black, white, and brown cat. $18 at Uncommon Goods Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Camera Retrospekt Hello Kitty Polaroid Camera The old-tech revival is gathering pace as vinyl, film cameras, and dumbphones make an unlikely comeback. Retrospekt is dedicated to delivering retro tech to the new generation, and that includes refurbished Polaroid cameras. The innards are from the ’80s and ’90s, but the Hello Kitty exterior is newly molded. My daughter loves the design of the camera and the instant nature of Polaroid photos and has been happily snapping our cats. $179 at Retrospekt Photograph: Simon Hill Cat Bowls CAT By Dr Lisa Corner Bowls Redesigning the humble bowl is bold, but these thoughtful CAT Corner Bowls are well thought out. Raised so your precious doesn’t have to stoop to eat from the floor, and shallow so her whiskers don’t keep bumping the rim. They are not made of plastic but rather 100 percent compostable bamboo fiber and cornstarch. They come with nonslip mats and can go in the dishwasher. Our cats seem to love them. $75 at CAT By Dr Lisa Gift Guides 🧑🏻‍🍳 Gifts for the Home Chef 🏠 Best Housewarming Gifts ✈️ Gifts for Travelers ☕️ Gifts for Coffee Addicts 💼 Gifts for Coworkers 😴 Gifts for a Good Night’s Sleep 👩🏻 Gifts for Moms 👖 Gifts for Men 🎥 Best Star Wars Gifts 🧱 Gifts for Lego Lovers 🎧 Viral TikTok Gifts Worth a Look ⌨️ Gifts for PC Gamers 🎶 Gifts for Music Lovers 📚 Best Gift for Book Lovers 📦 Best Subscription Boxes 📆 Best Advent Calendars 🔢 Creative White Elephant Gifts ☕️ Gifts Under $25 🧤 Our Favorite Stocking Stuffers 🎁 See All Gift Guides Simon Hill has been testing and writing about tech for more than 15 years.
