He spent six years spearheading buying guides and consumer tech coverage at Digital Trends. In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside a black rendition of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 . Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE , but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had. But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11 , launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind. That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get to the deals.

It’s also thinner and lighter than its predecessors. Read More $359 at Amazon $359 at Walmart $429 at Best Buy The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.

That being said, it’s currently on sale at Walmart right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting at $359 ($70 off) — which is also the second-best price we’ve seen — while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Walmart starting at $399 ($100 off).

The best Apple Watch Series 9 deals Apple Watch Series 9 $ 280 $ 399 30 % off $ 280 The Apple Watch Series 9 represents a slight upgrade over the prior model, the Apple Watch Series 8. It uses Apple’s S9 SiP processor and second-gen ultra wideband chip, though there aren’t many significant differences beyond that. Read More $280 at Best Buy (41mm, GPS) $344 at Best Buy (45mm, LTE) In 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.

Luckily, the Series 9 is still on sale at Best Buy in the 41mm / GPS configuration starting at $279.99 ($119 off) or in the 45mm / LTE configuration starting at $343.99 (about $185 off). Read our Apple Watch Series 9 review . The best Apple Watch SE deals 2022 Apple Watch SE (40mm, GPS) $ 170 $ 249 32 % off $ 170 The latest SE borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it’s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE. Read More $170 at Amazon $189 at Walmart $249 at Best Buy 2022 Apple Watch SE (44mm, GPS) $ 200 $ 279 28 % off $ 200 Apple’s entry-level wearable represents a minor upgrade when compared to the prior SE, though it does sport a faster chipset and make use of many watchOS 11 features. Read More $200 at Amazon $219 at Walmart $279 at Best Buy The Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022 . It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).

If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale at Walmart starting at $199 ($130 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing at Walmart starting at $239 ($60 off).

It offers the brightest display of any wearable in Apple’s lineup, along with better battery life and improved performance. It sports Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP, too, allowing you to take advantage of Apple’s handy double tap feature. Read More $735 at Amazon (with Trail Loop) $735 at Amazon (with Ocean Band) $739 at Amazon (with Alpine Loop) The latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.

Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon with a Trail Loop or an Ocean Band starting at $734.89 (about $64 off), or with an Alpine Loop starting at $739 ($60 off). You can also pick it up at Best Buy with an Alpine Loop , a Trail Loop , or an Ocean Band starting at $739 ($60 off), which is a deal we rarely see at Best Buy. Read our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review . A note on the more premium models While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.
