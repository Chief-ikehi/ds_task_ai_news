Though not a great way to heat a whole home, space heaters can be indispensable for a late-evening movie night, a workbench in a chilly garage, or the home’s odd corners that refuse to heat. And if you live in an apartment building where you don’t control the heat, it may be your only way to feel OK in January. But safety and reliability are prime concerns, and so is a lot of dodgy and opaque marketing about “Hyperamics” or whatever-wave technology. Yes … we know heat might come in waves. So I turned down my thermostat and tested dozens of space heaters to find the ones that’ll warm you up as quickly and quietly and safely as possible. Alongside our blessedly silent and simple top pick, the Vornado MVH ($60) , we also sorted out which heaters might best suit specific needs, from the best bathroom heater to a space heater that doubles as an air purifier. Looking for more ways to tailor your air? Check out our guide to all things that improve your indoor air quality , as well as our specialized guides to the Best Air Purifiers , Best Humidifiers , Best Fans , and Best Dehumidifiers . Update April 2025: I added the Vornado Sensa Cribside Heater and De'Longhi Dragon oil radiator to my top picks, and added additional recommendations for the Dreo MC706 and Dreo Bathrooms. I also tested and added a number of additional heaters from Pelonis, Vornado, Morento, Honeywell, and Lasko that did not rank among our picks. Up Next I'm currently testing the Boldr Kelvin and De'Longhi Slim Style panel heater. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED .

How We Tested and What We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron When it comes to testing space heaters, there are a few main questions: How safe is it? How loud is it? How quickly and evenly can it heat a room? During intensive testing of dozens of space heaters, I lived for weeks in a home with the thermostat set to a chilly 65 degrees Fahrenheit. I tested how well and quickly each device heated a medium-size room (14 by 14 feet), and also how well it heated a small seating area in a larger, open-format space. To test each heater's thermostat and also measure the evenness of heating, I placed thermometers at three or more locations in each room, including behind the heater. I tested the loudness of each device with a decibel meter at 3 feet away and verified power usage with a wattmeter. To see whether the heater's exhaust put out painful levels of heat, I used an infrared thermometer to gauge precise surface temperatures. When in doubt, I put my own fingers on the line. Finally, I tested safety features and basic durability. I looked at independent safety certifications, of course. But I also rudely knocked over each device to verify how the device’s tip-over protections functioned, if at all, and verified that the device started working again when set back on its feet. To test overheat protection, I smothered each device with an old sheet to see whether the device shut itself off or whether it adjusted its power output to keep internal temperature low. If any device fails the tip-over or overheat tests, we don’t recommend it. If it’s significantly louder than 50 decibels at 3 feet, we don’t recommend it. If the heater breaks during routine operation, we don’t recommend it. Maddening rattles and squeaks are also disqualifying. We keep on testing our favorites through the cold season and beyond, to see how they hold up over time. And, of course, we continually subject more heaters to our testing regimen to see if other devices can oust our current faves. What Are the Different Types of Space Heaters? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Basically all electric space heaters do the same thing: They take electricity off the grid, usually 1,500 watts of it if you're in the United States, and turn that power into heat. The vast majority of space heaters, including ceramic heaters and PTC heaters , are electric resistance heaters . This means they run an electrical current through something that creates resistance: maybe an electric coil or maybe a specially designed ceramic. This quickly turns electricity into heat. Most space heaters use a fan to disperse this heat out into the world, where we all live. These forced-air convection heaters tend to be the fastest at quickly raising the temperature of the surrounding air. The air then heats you. And so while this variety heats quickly, it can take quite a bit of electricity to heat up a whole room. Oil-filled radiators , in contrast, heat up oil that circulates inside the device, which then emits heat to the surrounding room. These tend to heat up slower but offer even and lasting heat and are very quiet. These radiators operate on the same principle as steam radiators in buildings with a boiler room. And just like steam radiators, they can get really, really hot to the touch. Radiant heaters, such as infrared heaters, operate much like the sun or a campfire: Rather than heat the air, they heat objects or people directly by radiating energy toward them. Infrared devices heat the air only indirectly, via the objects it heats— much the same way the sun's heat radiates off baking city streets. The glow is immediately palpable as warmth, but you’ll need to be in the path of the radiation to feel it, and the thermometer might not immediately register the warmth you perceive. Infrared heaters tend to be best at making an individual in front of the heater feel a little warmer without using a lot of energy, making them a more common decision in large and lofty spaces or outside on a patio. Though they deliver heat differently, both infrared and oil-filled heaters are subject to the same wattage limitations, and have about the same efficiency, as electrical resistance heaters. The same cannot be said for heat pumps , a newer technology that's expected to provide the next generation of household heat. Heat pumps don't use energy to create heat. Instead, they move heat energy from one place to another. Accordingly, they require far less energy than other forms of heater . But household systems cost thousands to install. And while more affordable window and portable heat pumps are ramping up , they're not yet broadly available. Are Space Heaters Safe? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Yes, but also definitely no. Space heaters are much safer than they used to be. Modern space heaters are heavily regulated, especially regarding exposed heating elements and automatic shut-off switches to prevent overheating. But all heating devices require caution, and so do all devices that pull a lot of energy over long periods. The vast majority of residential heating fires start with actual fire—specifically in fireplaces and fuel burners . But space heaters accounted for more than a thousand fires in the US each year from 2017 to 2019, according to the US Fire Administration. Though this accounted for just 3 percent of heating fires overall, these led to more than 40 percent of fatalities, in part because portable heaters tend to be placed precisely where people are and because the resulting fires are far more likely to be unconfined. So treat your space heater with the caution and wild skepticism that it deserves. See WIRED's Guide to Space Heater Safety for a full rundown about how not to start fires or cause othr hazards. Our guide follows recommendations from federal experts at the the USFA and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) , as well as the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) . But for the short version: Don’t leave a space heater unattended. \"Unattended” includes sleeping, y’all! Might we suggest a wonderful down comforter instead? When possible, safety experts also recommend you don't leave a portable heater running unattended in a room with a baby, nor a person with mobility issues. The risk isn’t just fire but hyperthermia. Plug your heater directly into the outlet. Don't use extension cords or power strips with space heaters, lest you build up too much electrical load and risk a fire. Don’t plug another appliance into the same outlet or circuit as the space heater. Place a space heater only on the floor, on a level surface. Heat rises. You don't need to prop up a heater on an unstable chair or table. Keep your heater at least 3 feet from flammable objects. This includes bedding, drapes, furniture, clothes, papers, books. All of that. Keep space heaters away from water and dampness, whether in bathrooms or in moist basements prone to dripping or flooding. Read the manual. Manufacturers have good advice. Are Large Heaters More Powerful Than Small Ones? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Nope! It may seem counterintuitive, but large heaters don't necessarily heat any better than small ones. Whatever their physical size, most space heaters in the US and Canada deliver about the same amount of heat. Space heaters top out at 1,500 watts, which is the highest safe operating load for a 15-amp household circuit. And aside from some low-power personal heaters here and there, most space heaters you'll find on the market are 1,500-watt heaters. What's more, electric space heaters are all pretty much 100 percent efficient in converting that electricity to heat . Whether directly or indirectly, nearly all of that energy will eventually become heat. So if space heaters are the same power and the same efficiency, why are some 1,500-watt heaters advertised for small rooms and some for large rooms? This likely has as much to do with marketing as science. Pretty much every ceramic, electric-coil, or PTC heater has about the same amount of juice and thus the same ability to heat a room … at least eventually. What differs among heaters is how and where the heat gets distributed and how fast. All other things being equal, the efficacy of a heater is mostly about whether it puts the heat where you want it to go. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Best Overall Space Heater Vornado MVH Whole Room Heater The heat from this little Vornado can feel like a form of magic: spooky action at a distance. The MVH is remarkably quiet, a volume somewhere between a whisper and the rustle of a stream. At 6 feet, the breeze from its fan is barely perceptible. Not only does its chassis stay cool to the touch, you can rest a hand on its heat exhaust without pain. When I first turned it on, I suspected it might be broken. And yet within 15 minutes, a thermometer on my far back wall registered 5 degrees hotter, slightly higher than the thermometer right in front of the heater. See what I mean? Spooky. The magic, apparently, is a “vortex action” technology that sends out a column of gently spiraling warm air to bounce off walls and disperse—an explanation that sounds like marketing snake oil but whose results are measurable. While multiple Vornado heaters claim mastery of the vortex, the MVH offers the best mix of fast and even heating, simplicity, safety, and quietude. Tip-over shutoff is near-instantaneous, and overheat protection is likewise reliable. Vornado's five-year warranty, with good service reports from customers online, is also a bonus. But note that the MVH is analog, with a mechanical thermostat, and there's no fan for summer use. It does only what it does, and does it well. For a similar but slightly louder digital model with a fan and digital readout, get the Vornado AVH10 . To add a timer and a remote, get the Vornado TAV10 . I discuss these options at greater length lower in this article. Specs Heater type Forced air, electric resistance Heating/cooling modes Three heating modes: 1500W, 1100W, 750W Thermostat Yes, mechanical Remote No Timer No Safety features Mechanical tip-over switch, overheat shutoff Operating noise 38–40 decibels $70 $60 at Amazon $70 $60 at Wayfair Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Best Heater With Purifier Dyson Purifier Hot + Cool HP07 The HP07 isn’t just a heater. It’s an app-enabled air quality sensor, a HEPA and carbon air filter, a hydrometer, an actually accurate thermometer, a cooling fan … and, yes, a classic resistance heater. Like most Dyson fans, it looks like a droid without a face. The Dyson's actual fan is hidden in its base, pushing hot or cool air around the top loop and blasting it out using what Dyson proudly announces is “jet engine technology.” If you turn up the fan full blast, it’ll sound like it. Other quirks include nonexistent paper instructions, which are hidden instead in the settings function of a phone app. (Dyson says this is to save the earth, though they could have first nixed the overgenerous cardboard packaging.) The U.S. version of the device and phone app both lack temperature controls, so woe betide those who lose the wee remote that affixes magnetically to the heater's top. And yet: Lord, it's nifty. Though priced accordingly, the HP07 is the most sophisticated home atmospheric management tool I tested for this guide. It heats the room evenly and quickly, has no exposed elements or blades, cleans easily, looks kinda fun, continually filters small particles from the air, and remains cool to the touch. Its accurate thermostat is a unicorn-level rarity among space heaters. Meanwhile the app provides extensive environmental information and tracks it over time, which becomes a sort of hobby if you let it. If you don’t care about the smart-app whizbangery, the first-generation HP10 costs a couple hundred less and doesn’t connect to the app. Specs Heater type Forced air, electric resistance Heating and cooling modes 1500W max heater, power regulated by thermostat and fan strength; fan for cooling Thermostat Yes, digital Remote/app Full control via remote; app offers monitoring but can't turn on heat Timed shut-off Yes Safety features Tip-over sensor at 45 degrees, overheat shutoff Operating noise 50 decibels at moderate settings, up to 60 at highest fan speed $750 $373 at Amazon $750 $550 at Dyson $750 $550 at Best Buy Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Best Silent Oil-Filled Radiator Delonghi Dragon Oil-Filled Radiator Oil-filled radiators like this Dragon from De’Longhi are a different beast from the resistive heaters on this list. The Dragon contains a reservoir of temperature-stable, diathermic oil that circulates within the radiator. The oil takes a little while to heat up, but when it does, the large thermal mass means that the heat radiated by the Dragon is stable and even. The Dragon is also a large device, 2 feet tall and more than a foot deep, and its entire surface gets quite hot to the touch. So why would you ever prefer it to a resistance heater like the others on this list? Silence, and evenness of heat. Aside from a somewhat irritating beepiness on the control panel, the Dragon is utterly silent while in operation. The temperature regulation on its thermostat ends up being quite accurate, though it may take more than an hour to stabilize its gentle heat all over the room. But when it's stable, it's stable. Anecdotally, oil-filled radiators also seem to dry out the air less than a fan-blowing ceramic. But especially, the Dragon's great for bedtime. The hot oil inside the radiator keeps emitting heat even after you've turned it off, which means you can turn it on an hour before bedtime to warm up the room, then shut it off before you sleep and still remain toasty. (The Dragon also has a timed shutoff function.) The Dragon's antifreeze feature also makes it a great tool for greenhouses and basements, turning on whenever the ambient temperature reaches 41 degrees or lower. Specs Heater type Oil-filled radiator Heating/cooling modes Three power settings, from 750W to 1500W Thermostat Yes, digital Remote No Timer Timed turn-on or shut-off, half-hour to 24 hours Safety features 45-degree tip-over trigger, overheat shutoff Operating noise Inaudible $150 at Amazon Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Best Smart Bathroom Heater and Wall Heater Dreo Smart Wall-Mounted Heater with ALCI plug A cold bathroom in the morning feels cruel and unnecessary. But a space heater on the floor can feel reckless in a room with a bathtub. A fixed wall unit, mounted away from the shower, is a more credible solution to early-morning shivers. This slim-profiled Dreo offers IP24 certification against splashes, plus the same ALCI plug you’ll find on your hairdryer to prevent shocks. The heater’s app-enabled smart function means you can turn the heater on from the warmth of your bed, and bask in the glow of a warm bathroom by the time you arrive. It's also great for your home's other cool spots that lack convenient floor space. The wall-mounted Dreo heats a mid-sized room within 15 minutes, though even heat distribution depends strongly on central wall placement. Other helpful phone-app features include usage tracking over time, Alexa voice compatibility, and button-push calibration of the thermostat. You'll need that calibration: The thermostat on this unit fares better than earlier-generation devices from Dreo, but can still be confused by light breezes or the device’s own heat source. Installation is pretty straightforward, provided you've hung a framed picture before. But make sure to mount the Dreo high enough to be out of reach for curious youngsters. While the housing stays cool, the heat exhaust vent can get hot to the touch. Specs Heater type Forced air, electric resistance Heating modes Three heating modes: 1500W with high or low fan, 900W; cooling fan mode Thermostat Yes, digital Remote/app Remote and phone app offer full control Timer Full on/scheduling capability Safety features Overheat throttle and shutoff Operating noise 44–48 decibels $120 $108 at Amazon $120 at Dreo Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Best Fast Heat Blast Lasko Ellipse Ceramic Tabletop Heater This little ceramic number from Lasko was the space heater I kept reaching for while testing dozens of other space heaters. It's not the most obvious choice: It doesn't heat a room evenly, its grill surface gets wackily hot, and the thermostat is an inside joke. I'm not sure I'd run it near babies or small dogs. And yet I still kept voting for it with my cold, cold feet. Why? Because this little thing can radically change my whole experience of life within about 15 seconds of being turned on. It brings the heat, as they say, though mostly within an 8-foot radius. Within that manifold, it’s like living inside a hair dryer, which is more pleasant than it sounds. You’re warm and lovely from your heart-cockles to your cankles. On the safety front, the device’s tip-over and overheat shutoff work as quickly and as well as any heater I tested. The remote control is a welcome convenience to turn down the heat blast whenever I start to feel like a roast duck. Specs Heater type Forced air, ceramic electric resistance Heating/cooling modes Three heater power settings, from 900W to 1500W Thermostat Yes, digital Remote Yes Timer Tmed shut-off, half-hour to 12 hours Safety features 45-degree tip-over trigger, overheat shutoff Operating noise 48–52 decibels $65 at Amazon $65 at Walmart Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Best Budget Heater for a Garage Honeywell Uberheat 5 Ceramic Space Heater North Carolina-based Honeywell offers good value at the no-nonsense end of the heater spectrum, without sacrificing any safety features. I’m partial to the straightforward honesty of the Uberheat 5, which pushes heat, quickly, from a small and simple package. It also looks like a tiny guitar amp, if that's a selling point. You’ll find these little no-frills Honeywells in countless greenhouses and garages and utility rooms. There are just two settings, 900 watts and 1500 watts. The thermostat is a truly analog mechanical switch, which can offer fine tuning and a lot of flexibility across a broad temperature range. Just note that while the housing and handle stay cool, the heater's broad exhaust grate gets pretty hot and it's a bit louder than other top choices—which is why we like it best as a utility heater. Also, while we tested the black-cased version , for whatever reason the white-colored variant is priced significantly lower . Specs Heater type Forced air, electric resistance Heating/cooling modes Two power settings: 1500W, 900W Thermostat Yes, mechanical Remote No Timer No Safety features Mechanical tip-over switch, overheat throttle and shutoff Operating noise 50 decibels $37 $34 at Amazon $37 at Target Photograph: Dreo A Quiet Tower Heater Dreo Solaris 718 I have mixed feelings about tower heaters. In theory, towers are great because they're tall and people are tall, and so the heat they release is closer to our heads. But in practice, heat rises all by itself, and compact heaters with the same power work just as well. Meanwhile, towers topple easily, their tall silhouette makes them conspicuous in a room, and they can be more difficult to clean. But this low-key conical Dreo Solaris 718 has won me over a bit, despite its nonzero resemblance to a Dalek from Doctor Who . It’s among the most wondrously silent heaters I tested—nearly inaudible at its lowest setting and still restrained at full steam. So far, it’s also free from cheaper oscillating heaters’ tendency to groan or squeak while rotating from side to side. The Solaris heats quickly and distributes its warmth nonchalantly about the room; its housing stays approachably cool. Alas, the built-in thermostat is just as wonky as most other space heaters on the market, so you’re better off using the remote to choose among the Solaris' five steady heat settings. Specs Heater type Forced air, electric resistance Heating/cooling modes Five power settings from 750W to 1500W. Three fan settings. Eco/thermostat mode Thermostat Yes, digital Remote/app Remote Timer 1 to 12-hour timed shutoff Safety features 45-degree tip-over sensor, overheat throttle and shutoff Operating noise 38–42 decibels $130 at Amazon $130 at Dreo Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Best External Sensor With an Accurate Thermostat Vornado Sensa Cribside Heater OK, OK, OK, so this thing's sold as a space heater for baby rooms, a category of thing I find a little iffy: Federal experts advise against leaving space heaters unattended in rooms with sleeping infants. And yet, this Sensa is nonetheless one of my favorite space heaters I've come across this year ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends .) Why? Because aside from being quiet and effective, it comes with an ingenious feature I want to see from more space heaters: an external temperature sensor that is not housed inside the space heater, inches from a very hot heating element. This external sensor means the Sensa's thermostat is accurate within a single degree Fahrenheit, a feat not managed by almost any space heater I've tested that isn't a large, $700 Dyson. It's silly that we've all come to accept that space heater thermostats are terrible. No one would ever measure a building's temperature from inside the boiler room, let alone the boiler itself. The accurate external temperature sensor on this Sensa should be a path forward for other space heaters. Note that the Sensa has a mandatory child lock, so it's a little fiddly to turn on and off. Specs Heater type Forced air, electric resistance Heating/cooling modes Low and high power settings. 1200 watt max. Thermostat Yes, both an internal thermostat and an external paired temperature sensor Remote/app Remote Timer 1- to 12-hour timed shutoff Safety features 45-degree tip-over sensor, overheat shutoff Operating noise 52-54 decibels $150 at Amazon $150 at Walmart $150 at Home Depot More Space Heaters I Recommend Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Vornado AVH10 for $99 and Vornado TAVH10 for $140 : Vornado has an unholy variety of models that look quite similar but have different levels of loudness and different feature sets. Some are built in America, some in China. In general, the models I've liked best are the ones that advertise “vortex action,” a fancy name for spinning a fan into a spiral grate oriented opposite to the action of the fan. This leads to a mostly quiet and nigh-undetectable column of warm air, directed out to the back of the room, where it scatters. The non-digital MVH is my favorite: the most silent, the most reasonably priced. Because it's analog, the MVH can also be regulated by a temperature-controlled power outlet in order to get the most accurate version of a thermostat. But the MVH is not exactly a feature-rich device. The digital AVH10 and TAVH10 are also quiet, though not quite as quiet as the MVH. They also cost more. But the AVH10 adds a fan and a digital temperature readout. The TAV10 adds to these a timer and a remote. Dreo MC706 for $170 : New this year, Dreo’s innovative 2-in-1 fan/heater won top marks in our fan guide for its auto-shift positive temperature coefficient (PTC) technology, which moves the heater's ceramic element aside to allow full fan airflow. Its 1,700 ft/m wind speed is a rarity among tower fans, let alone tower fan/heater combos. It’s not the strongest space heater, but it is sufficient, with five settings, 120-degree oscillation, and tip-over protection. Note that though there is a remote, there are no smart features, and it does not work with Dreo’s app. Dreo Bathroom Heater for $60: Like Dreo's smart wall-mounted model I far prefer, this ceramic heater comes with an ALCI plug for safe use near water. I prefer to keep bathroom heaters away from the floor, but not all bathrooms have mountable wall space. This remains a possible, though not ideal alternative, with a somewhat janky thermostat. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Also Tested Pelonis 16-Inch Space Heater for $65 and Pelonis 23-Inch Space Heater for $70: Both of these towers heated up quite quickly. Both were also enormously hot at the surface of their vents, with relatively little shielding from the visible heating elements. The 23-inch was significantly quieter than the 16-inch, however. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Morento 26-cm Heater for $60 and Morento 40-cm Heater for $59 : Both of these Morento heaters were pretty quiet. But they also had the highest surface temperatures across their front vent of any space heaters I tested: The smaller, 26-centimeter tower measured 207 degrees Fahrenheit on its face, nearly hot enough to boil water. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Vornado VMHi600 for $190: This large cube was about as quiet as the AVH10, staying below 60 decibels, but its vent got quite hot—about 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Other Vornado models perform far better at a far lower price. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Vornado Velocity Cube 5S for $100: This cube's outer housing stayed quite cool, and the fan functionality is welcome. But its surface vent got a little hot, and the fan was a bit on the noisy side compared to other Vornados. Vornado Velocity 5R Whole Room Heater for $97 and Vornado VHEAT for $160 : Our top pick MVH from Vornado is one of the quietest space heaters I've tested. These were two of the loudest. The 5R topped 70 decibels. The vintage-looking VHEAT is quite lovely, but it's also a bit of a noisemaker. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Lasko MyHeat Mini for $25: This little thing looked cute, and I thought it would be a nice desktop or under-table personal heater. But even with its low output at 400 watts, the vent got way too hot to want it anywhere near your laptop or papers. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Lasko 22-inch Oscillating Tower With Remote for $57: This one failed our tip-over test when we knocked it over, blasting heat endlessly into the rug until it overheated and sent a burnt-plastic smell into the air. It did restart hours later, meaning this shutoff was a safety feature. But this tower's a bit too tall and tippable to risk repeating these events often. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Honeywell 2-Position Heater for $45: This compact, simple, analog heater was a nice enough idea, able to rest vertically or on its side. Lord, it's loud when its fan is in operation, though. Photograph: Matthew Korfhage Honeywell Compact Ceramic Tower for $43: This Honeywell performed well in terms of fast heat and safe surface temperature. Its fan wasn't too loud either. But the one we received had a maddening squeak each time the tower oscillated fully counterclockwise.
