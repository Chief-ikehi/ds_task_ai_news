Maybe it’s a hallmark of having worked from home for eight years and counting, or the burden I bear from being a millennial, but to me, blue jeans are an occassion pant. Even when I’m out in a skirt or dress, the second I get home, I’m putting on sweatpants. My favorite pair has been the Vuori Performance Joggers, ever since I first tried them back in 2020 for a now-defunct buying guide. These sweatpants have been beloved across the internet since then and probably before it. Influencers, reviewers, and redditors sing their praises. I’m not saying anything new. These pants have 4.8 out of 5 stars based on over 46,000 customer reviews. But if you haven’t heard the gospel, please do yourself the courtesy of listening to me proselytize for just one moment. I know a ton of differently shaped people who love these sweatpants. I’m short and curvy, but friends and colleagues with different body types swear by these sweatpants. Be you tall or short, slim or thick, no matter your gender, your weight, or where you like to wear your loungewear, these’ll work for you. They’re like magic.

How hard can it be to get it right? So perhaps my love for the Vuori Performance Joggers is best illustrated with details about what they don’t get wrong. I spoke with Sarah Carlson, vice president of design at Vuori, to lift the curtain a bit. Let’s start with the fabric. The Vuori’s DreamKnit fabric is special. Carlson says it’s made with advanced knitting techniques to promote a second-skin feel, and she says it is meant to “provide a buttery-soft feel while delivering the durability and functionality needed for active lifestyles.” I’ll be the first to admit I’m skeptical of any marketing claims, but these sweatpants genuinely are so soft and stretchy. DreamKnit is made with 89 percent recycled materials. It has four-way stretch, which keeps it flexible, and it’s designed to keep you cool and dry. It’s not too thin or too thick. If I wear these sweatpants in the fall, they keep me pretty warm. If I wear them in the summer, I don’t get too hot. I can regulate my own body temperature. They’re not aggressively lined or bulky or thick. They just work. In the winter, or on particularly windy days, they aren’t the warmest, but that breathability is a feature and not a bug. Photograph: Vuori Carlson says, \"The initial concept for DreamKnit came from our desire to create a fabric that felt as good as it performed.” And it does! She adds that each iteration was wear-tested by athletes, yogis, and everyday users to get feedback on fit, feel, and functionality. Vuori also conducted lab tests to ”ensure the fabric could withstand repeated washing and activity without losing its shape or softness.” The slash pockets are thoughtfully designed, too, with enough depth that I can stash my phone, wallet, and other essentials inside—and, most importantly, nothing falls out when I sit down or shift around. This is a surprisingly common issue I’ve found while testing sweatpants. What’s the point in a pocket if things don’t stay inside it? Again, the Performance Joggers have pockets that work as intended. And they don’t stick out or show an obvious outline while I walk around—another added benefit that other sweatpants haven’t managed to achieve. Carlson says that “fit is everything, and we spent countless hours perfecting the cut of the Performance Joggers. They’re designed to be relaxed but not sloppy, with a tapered leg that flatters the body without restricting movement. The elastic waistband with an adjustable drawstring ensures a customizable, secure fit.” Even the drawstring is well designed. It doesn’t slip too easily out of its sleeve, and it’s not too thick or obvious. It’s soft on my skin. It’s flat and therefore easy to tie, and it stays tied throughout the day. I can adjust the sweatpants to sit high on my natural waist or sling them low around my hips. The drawstring doesn’t create an obvious outline or get twisted up over time. It simply works as intended. Photograph: Vuori … Anywhere And the length of the pants is just right. On my 5’1” frame, I don’t find them to be too long or too short. But reviewers who are taller than me have said the same thing. Like I said—these are like magic. The actual inseam length is 25 inches. The sweatpants keep their shape throughout the day, and the cuff loosens imperceptibly if at all. The ankle cuff is tight enough to help the pants maintain their shape but not so tight that it pulls them down or restricts movement. And finally, the silhouette. Vuori suggests ordering a size up if you want an oversized fit. I wear my usual size, and I find that the pants are tight and loose in all the right places. They hug my hips and butt, they nip in my waist, and they’re a little tight toward the ankles. The shape is downright flattering, and I feel just as comfy wearing them with a gigantic fleece-lined hoodie while lounging as I do pairing them with a bodysuit and some cute sneakers while going out or over my shorts to the gym. I’ve worn these to chill on the couch during the holidays at my parents’ house. I’ve worn these while hanging out around the campfire. I’ve worn these to my favorite bar. I’ve worn these on a date. They just work. If you conjure a pair of sweatpants in your head, they‘d probably be the Vuori Performance Joggers—whether or not you realize it yet. I appreciate the wide variety of colors (14 at press time) and sizes (XXS to XXL in Regular or Long lengths). I appreciate the way these hold up over time, maintaining their softness and shape over nearly five years of wear. But mostly, I appreciate that they absolutely nail everything a pair of comfy pants should be. They’re expensive, but to me, they’re worth every penny. Photograph: Vuori",
