Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Best Poop Bag Dispenser Earth Rated Dog Poop Bag Dispenser I've used dozens of poop bag dispensers over my dog’s lifetime. I had one shaped like a fire hydrant and another that looked like a designer handbag; I've used the plain old oval ones available at every pet store, too. They all sucked. Often, the bag is hard to pull out, or the quality is so poor that the holder breaks after a year or two. Earth Rated's dispenser is different. I can't think of another product under $10 that has impressed me so much in recent memory. It's designed so that every time you pull out a new bag, it comes out perfectly flat, not crumpled. (It's designed for Earth Rated's poop bag rolls, but I have tested it with others and it works fine.) When you're out of bags, pop open the bottom, insert a new roll, and align the start of the roll with the gap. That's it. The pull for every new bag is so satisfying because it's smooth and doesn't snag. You even get a little tab to hang a full bag until you find a trash can, and there's a sturdy silicone strap at the top that lets you attach it to a leash. I've had mine for nearly a year, and it still functions perfectly. $6 at Amazon $6 at Walmart $6 at Chewy $6 at Target Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Best Dog Poop Bags Earth Rated Dog Poop Bags I also really like Earth Rated's poop bags. You can get them scented, but do you want to smell a mixture of lavender and dog poop? I don't. I have had to pick up my dog's business from a variety of surfaces, and the worst is when it's nestled in grass. You want to make sure to grab it all, but then you start worrying that your finger will dig too much into the bag and poke a hole. Yes, this has happened, but not with an Earth Rated bag! These green bags are thick and strong, and I've never had a tear or leak. They're made from 65 percent post-consumer recycled plastic, so I feel a little better when I toss ’em in the trash. The company is a certified B Corp , meaning it meets high standards for social and environmental impact. $17 $14 at Amazon $14 at Chewy $19 at Walmart $21 at Target Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Great Water Bottle Little Chonk Lil Gulp Dog Water Bottle There are many doggie water bottles, but Little Chonk's Lil Gulp has some thoughtful design flourishes that make it one of my favorites. First, it's adorable, with nostalgic color schemes that may remind you of toys from the '90s. There’s a soft carry handle at the top for easy toting, and you can pull out the BPA-free flask to unveil a trough. Push the button on the side of the bottle, and water spews out from a hole into this trough. You can have your pup lap it up while holding the bottle or lay it flat—it's designed to stay put on surfaces without rolling around. If there's some water left, you can push the button and tilt the bottle so it all goes back in. I've been using the Lil Gulp for several months—it has never leaked, and my dog took to it immediately. Better yet, a built-in carbon filter keeps the water contaminant-free. You'll have to replace this every 90 days, but if you're always pouring filtered water into the bottle at home before heading out, you don't have to bother with it. It's worth noting that only the bottle and filter cradle are top-rack dishwasher safe—the silicone is not, so hand-wash it. I have only one gripe: It requires a little bit of force to pull the transparent bottle out of the trough, and there's not enough area to grip and pull on the front easily. At least it mostly fits in my car's cup holder. $35 at Amazon $35 at Little Chonk Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Cushy Pet Bed Buffy Orthopedic Pet Bed It pains me to say it, but my dog is getting older. Every time he jumps off my bed, I immediately start thinking about the wear on his joints. We've had Casper's Pet Bed for about a year, which he still likes, but he took to Buffy's Orthopedic Pet Bed far more quickly. I had to coax him a few times to use the Casper, but he immediately hopped on the Buffy as soon as I put it down. I would too. It looks super cozy. The small version of this bed was just right for my nearly 20-pound dog, but it will probably be way too big for anyone with a 15-pound pooch or smaller. You can also get the standard size or the “oversized” model, designed for dogs 50 pounds or more. This is an orthopedic bed, so there are three layers of foam: a comfort layer, an orthopedic layer designed to distribute weight and support their joints, and a gel memory foam layer. It's plush, soft, and durable—my dog has already tried to “dig” in it, and the removable cover doesn't look any worse for wear. That said, I have the corduroy version, so I don't know how the sherpa cover would fare. The little pillow attaches via Velcro straps and doesn't budge. It's a nice little resting spot for their teeny heads. Both the cover and pillow are machine washable—just let them air dry. $105 $84 at Buffy Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Your Dog's Office Chair SeatMate Pet Office Chair Working from home has a lot of perks. I get to be with my dog all day! But anyone with a small pup will know it's hard to be at a desk and pet them when they're all the way on the floor. SeatMate's Pet Office Chair is a fantastic solution, and I was shocked at how quickly my dog felt comfortable enough to run up its retractable ramp. This chair took a few minutes to assemble, and the faux fur seat is soft. It supports dogs up to 35 pounds, though my dog is 19 pounds and a bit of a long boy, so it only just fits him. If he was a little longer, he might have some trouble stretching out. Now, my dog's at the perfect height for all the pets. He can see exactly what I'm doing that's so much more important than petting him 24/7. Most of the time he snoozes next to me, but that's also adorable. $400 $299 at SeatMate Photograph: Julian Chokkattu For Rainy Days Geometry Plush Dog Towel For seven years of my dog's life, I've been drying him off after a walk in the rain, or a bath, with a raggedly old towel I've owned since college (eek). I never really thought about getting a dog-specific towel, but I wish I’d made the swap sooner. Not only do Geometry's Plush Dog Towels look super cute, but they're thicker than the towel I was using and much more appropriately sized. These towels are made from postconsumer recycled materials. There are many prints to choose from, though they appear only on one side. They absorb water quickly and thankfully don't smell funky even after several uses. $20 at Geometry Photograph: Furbo Best Dog Camera Furbo 360 Dog Camera It's been around for a few years, but the Furbo 360 ( 9/10, WIRED Recommends ) remains a good dog camera if you want to keep an eye on your canine when you're not home. Specifically, a ground-level eye on them. This pet camera spins 360 degrees so you can get a full view of the room, but since it can automatically track your dog, you don't have to hunt for them. It also pulls double-duty as a treat machine, tossing them out from the little hole in the front. Like most pet cameras , it has two-way communication and bark notifications. The video quality is 1080p, and it has night vision support for low light. Should you feel the need, Furbo has a subscription service that sends safety alerts about smoke or carbon monoxide, chewing alerts, and can spot intruders. You can also ask questions about your pet, like whether they ate today, assuming your dog's bowl is in view of the camera. All these events are saved as 15-second clips on the cloud that you can access anytime, anywhere. I don't need another thing to subscribe to, so I don't think it's worth it. $210 $169 at Amazon $210 at Furbo Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Wipe Their Feet Caboo Bamboo Pet Wipes Imagine walking barefoot outside on the street and then walking into your home, on the carpet, couch, and bed. That's pretty much what your dog does! It's a good idea to wipe their feet. My wife and I have been using Caboo's Bamboo Pet Wipes for a few years. These wet wipes are easy to pull out of the tube and do a good job of grabbing all the grubby dirt from my dog's paws. I can't speak much about the company's sustainability claims—bamboo has its perks , but it's a notorious greenwashing ploy . $23 at Amazon Photograph: Yeti Best Dog Bowl Yeti Boomer 8 Dog Bowl It physically pains me to recommend a $60 water bowl. But before WIRED editor Adrienne So got it, she probably spent as much on mats and stands to keep cheaper water bowls from being kicked, stepped in, and splashed all over the kitchen. Yeti’s bowl is capacious and heavy enough to not get kicked over if you walk too close to it. It holds eight cups of water and has a nonslip base. You can also throw it in the dishwasher when it gets grody. $80 at Amazon $60 at Dick's Sporting Goods $60 at Yeti Photograph: Kat Merck A Stylish and Comfy Pet Carrier Dagne Dover Kyoto Pet Carrier (Large) I took my dog to the beach with this airline-approved carrier and on a flight to Louisville, Kentucky, and it's far more stylish than it has any right to be. The sherpa base is plush and removable, so it's easy to clean, and there's mesh all around to ensure good airflow. There are two zippered pockets for treats and other accessories, and a luggage pass-through strap, which we used at the airport to roll our pup around. The best part is the lengthy shoulder strap. Sometimes the shoulder straps on these bags are too short and uncomfortable, but it worked for my 6'4\" frame—it's great toting him around with his head sticking out of the bag. You can plop your dog into this carrier in three ways: the two sides or the top. I tried the large version, which is good for dogs up to 20 pounds, but there's a small version for dogs up to 15 pounds. The carrier is made from Global Recycled Standard–certified 900-denier polyester, which equals 32 recycled bottles. $340 $239 at Dagne Dover Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Viral Dog Backpack Little Chonk The Maxine One This Instagram-famous backpack ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ) hails from the owner of Instagram-famous Maxine the Fluffy Corgi . (Little Chonk also makes the Lil Gulp I recommend above.) The Maxine One comes in two sizes, small and medium, and the latter worked best for my 18-pound dog . Loading your pet into it can be tricky—your pup will need some coaxing and encouragement—but once they’re in, they’ll be securely affixed to your back. This is by far the biggest barrier to using the bag, because it can take some time to put them in. When the deed is done, it frees up your arms to carry groceries (or, let’s be real, a latte). Be prepared for the sudden increase in attention from passersby. This backpack won’t work for every dog. (Talk to your vet if you’re concerned.) If your dog is 35 pounds or more, you likely don’t want all that weight on your back, though the company now sells a dog backpack for much larger dogs . Little Chonk also recommends limiting the time your dog is in the bag to 50 minutes. In my testing, I found the backpack arm straps were hard to tighten, and one of the straps started to fray. The company says it tweaked them in the current version. $120 at Amazon $120 at Little Chonk Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Or Grab a Dog Tote Roverlund Out-and-About Pet Tote Pro Edition If a backpack won’t work for your pup, the easier option is a shoulder bag. I've used Roverlund’s Out-and-About Pet Tote for several years, though that model was discontinued in favor of the Out-and-About Pet Tote Pro Edition. It's very similar but has a little more structure, thinner straps, and larger pockets. You can get it in a small or large size, with the latter accommodating most dogs up to 30 pounds. There was plenty of room for my 19-pound pup in the original, and the base was stable and soft. My gripe was the abnormally tiny pocket on the side, but this has been resolved in the Pro Edition. There is a built-in carabiner—handy for attaching a dog leash. $149 at Roverlund Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Toy Chest Julie Eves Woodworking Wood Dog Toy Storage Box Every time my pup hangs by the entrance of our local pet store, my wife asks if we should get him a toy. Naturally, now we have more than 30. This is all for a dog that notoriously plays with his toys for two minutes, tops. Welp. I bought this toy chest from Etsy and it's an excellent way to shove them all in there—an attractive and dog-themed piece of wood furniture! There's a little cutout at the bottom where toy-loving dogs can grab something to play with. Assembly was fast and easy. You can choose the style of the cutout (bone or paw), choose a stain, and even personalize it with your dog's name. $118 at Etsy Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Great Dog Jackets Blueberry Pet My wife and I have bought and used Blueberry Pet's jackets and hoodies for years now, and they're still in top condition. The hoodie is lightweight and not too tight for my pup, and he looks so dang cool. The waterproof softshell is thicker and offers more coverage from rain—it's 95 percent polyester and 5 percent elastane—and you can keep the hood clipped so it doesn't flop around. I've walked my dog in many a rainstorm with this jacket and his body doesn't get wet. There's also a hole under the hood so you can connect a leash to a harness underneath. We have several items from Blueberry Pet, but these two have been standouts. Just make sure you measure your dog's length and follow the company's size guide before you buy. $19 at Amazon (Hoodie) $18 at Blueberry Pet (Hoodie) $30 at Amazon (Raincoat) $30 at Blueberry Pet (Raincoat) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Dog Ramp DoggoRamps Couch Ramp It's important to keep your dog's joints as healthy and strong as possible as they age. One way to do this is to help them climb up and down from high surfaces. I tested the DoggoRamp ( 9/10, WIRED Recommends ), which is a really expensive solution to this problem. Seriously, you can find stairs and other ramps for a lot less. But it's also beautifully made, and that might be very important if you want pet furniture to not look out of place in your home. It's also functional; you can adjust the height to varying angles and fold it flat to stow under a couch or bed. After a year of use, there are some scratches on the rubber mat, but it doesn't look any worse for wear, unlike my old, grubby foam stairs. This is the Couch Ramp, but I recommend you buy the Small Dog Bed Ramp or the Large Dog Bed Ramp for climbing up on a bed, as the incline isn't as steep. These are all made from solid hardwood in North America and arrive fully assembled. $225 at Amazon $225 at DoggoRamps Photograph: Amazon Best Bath Accessory Aquapaw Pet Bathing Tool What’s worse: your stinky dog or your dog’s stink eye? If your answer is both, then you’ll like the Aquapaw Pet Bathing Tool. It can connect to your showerhead via an included adapter (or to a garden hose). The adapter has a blue and black button to divert water from your showerhead to the tool—blue means the water will come out of the Aquapaw, and black means it’ll come out of your showerhead. When it’s time to bathe your dog, clip the sprayer/scrubber to your palm and press the On button. It cuts down bath time significantly and is less wasteful. $23 $20 at Amazon $20 $17 at Walmart Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Grooming Kit (That Vacuums!) Neakasa S1 Pro Pet Grooming System When I first unboxed the S1 Pro, I was overwhelmed. There are a lot of components to this machine. After you get over this hump and learn how to use it, it's a game-changer. It's essentially a mini vacuum that sucks in hair as you comb, demat, trim nails, or shave your dog's fur. No more clumps of hair stuck to your clothes or all around your floor as you groom your pup! All of these attachments sit on a carousel, so they're easy to find and grab. Best of all for the combs—you can comb your dog silently and then push a trigger to have it suck the hair out of the comb, allowing your dog to enjoy the experience without freaking out about the sound. There will be a sound when you use some of the other tools, though. I've predominantly used the clipper to trim my dog's butt hair (you get guide combs to adjust length), and there's a trim tool that's great for clipping hair in between his paw pads and nails. The nail grinder does a good job of whittling my dog's sharp claws down a bit. Overall, this is a better experience than the cheap electric pet razor I've used for several years with my dog. Clean-up is super simple, though you will need space to store it. You'll also need to replace some components over time, like the HEPA and sponge filters. $200 at Amazon $180 at The Home Depot Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Jacket for Winter Ruffwear Stumptown Quilted Dog Coat Your dog may have a fur coat, but that can only do so much when it’s blisteringly cold outside or pouring rain. Ruffwear’s Stumptown Quilted jacket quickly became my go-to for my dog. You’ll need to measure your pet to buy the right size. It’s made of 300-denier polyester ripstop with a DWR finish to make it water-repellant, and the inside is recycled polyester insulation for warmth. It’s not at all a hassle to secure, taking only a few seconds with the side-release buckles. Some extras include a reflective trim for extra visibility and a little cutout on the back to hook your leash to a harness underneath. When it gets dirty, toss it in the washing machine. $80 at Amazon $80 at Ruffwear Photograph: Ruffwear Best Harness Ruffwear Front Range Dog Harness WIRED senior editor Adrienne So’s dog, Roux, is a good dog. A really good dog. But like many pooches, she lacks impulse control. A squirrel or cat running away can send her into a frenzy, and she’s strong and not small. The Front Range harness is secure and padded, and it has two attachment points for the leash—one on the back for when Roux is in low-traffic areas and another for the front of the chest for when you're cautiously walking down Cat Alley. If she pulls, the front attachment means Roux will spin herself around to look at Adrienne, confused. It also has reflective strips for walking at night. She’s had it since 2020 and regularly throws it in the washer, and it looks none the worse for wear. $55 at Amazon $55 at REI $50 at Ruffwear Photograph: Adrienne So A Waist Pack to Carry Essentials Mazie Days the Charlie It is a well-known truism that whenever a couple gets a dog, a child may or may not also come along too. The pet accessory company Mazie Days makes other, smaller bags for walking your dog, but the Charlie is big enough to hold both last-minute dog and kid stuff. Since you’re on the move, it’s easy to grab everything at a moment’s notice. There’s an open-front pocket on the front so you don’t have to dig around for poop bags, an O-ring for your keys, and a phone pocket in the back. I also particularly like the tiny treat pouch that you can attach separately, so your lip gloss doesn’t end up smelling like pepperoni. While I do think that vegan leather is a scam (it’s plastic! Just say it’s plastic!), it also feels very soft and holds up well in the constant Oregon rain. —Adrienne So $148 at Mazie Days Photograph: Zeedog Best Hands-Free Leash Zee.Dog Gotham Hands-Free Leash Taking out two dogs is no walk in the park. Or rather, it is, but a highly coordinated, complicated walk in said park. That's why former WIRED reviewer Haley Sprankle fell in love with the Zee.Dog in all its sturdy, customizable glory. You adjust the size of the loop by sliding the buckle up or down, making it the perfect size to go on your waist, over the shoulder, or even as a regular hand-held leash. It also features an “E-Zee Lock” buckle that lets you more easily clip your dog to your chair at brunch, or wherever they need to be stationary, without fully unleashing them. The only thing I don’t like is that the harness clip doesn’t lock into place. Just make sure it doesn’t get caught on anything. $45 at Amazon $45 at Zee.Dog Photograph: Fi Best Pet Tracker Fi Series 3 Collar Pet trackers come in all shapes and sizes. If you want a simple clip to keep track of your pet, we like the Jiobit ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ). But if you want a sturdy, comfortable collar that’s easy to use with smart features, WIRED senior editor Adrienne So likes the Fi. We tested the original Fi Series 2 collar, but there's a newer Series 3. The Fi uses a combination of your home Wi-Fi, cellular, and GPS networks to keep track of your dog at home and to pinpoint them if they get lost. It can also track their fitness. There’s a built-in light if your dog is off-leash in the dark. The metal device is much classier and easier to charge than the fiddly plastic Whistle . Her most memorable experience using the Fi was walking to a neighbor’s house, getting an alert that her dog had escaped, and looking up to see her dog right behind her down the road. The Series 3 model is smaller and lighter and offers real-time live GPS tracking. The LTE signal has better range too, and this model has improved water resistance and battery life. $99 at Fi (6-Month Subscription) Photograph: Amazon Get a Bark Collar (If You Need It) Petsafe Bark Collar WIRED senior writer Scott Gilbertson's Jack Russell–pit bull mix is very, very protective of her people. She doesn’t have the best eyesight, which means she barks at everything, even plenty of things that aren’t there. But this collar helped curb that behavior. Unlike electric fence collars, this one doesn’t shock your pup. It just sprays a bit of mist on their nose. Dogs find this mist annoying enough that they will do anything to stop it. Gilbertson’s dog barked exactly twice with this collar on. And after a few weeks of wearing it at night, she lost the barking habit. He says he no longer puts it on her, and she rarely barks at night. It might not work with every dog, but if you have a dog that’s keeping you (or worse, your neighbors) up all night, it’s worth a try. $85 $75 at Amazon $75 at Chewy Photograph: Barkbox Best Subscription Box BarkBox It’s surprisingly hard to find good, affordable dog toys, especially if your pet can vaporize most of them in minutes. Tennis balls and tug ropes wear down teeth; small rubber toys break and can choke your dog—or, in one terrible instance, get caught in their anus on the way out. BarkBox designs toys and sends you two of them per month, in addition to two bags of treats and a chewy treat. My dog loved the toys and treats that came in the BarkBox, but it’s important to note that it ends up being a lot of toys and treats. Try it for a month first. There's no one-click way to skip a month, sadly. Alternatively, the company now sells many of its toys on Amazon , so you don't have to subscribe to just buy a few every so often. $20 at BarkBox $13 at Amazon (Toys) Photograph: Ruffwear Our Favorite Dog Boots Ruffwear Grip Trex Dog Boots Dog boots can help protect your pup's paws. However, you need to train your dog to walk with the shoes before going outside (give them lots of treats with every step!). WIRED senior editor Adrienne So says she rarely goes camping without dog boots after an incident where she and her husband had to carry two 70-pound dogs back to the car after discovering bits of sharp, volcanic glass on a trail in Oregon. Her dog will wear Ruffwear's Grip Trex boots instead of flopping around like her paws have been cut off. They’re small and easy to slip on, and they have Velcro around the ankle. They also have a breathable upper and a grippy Vibram sole. They’re washable and reflective in low light. $45 at Amazon $45 at REI $45 at Ruffwear Photograph: Parker Hall Best Virtual Fence SpotOn GPS Dog Fence This GPS-based dog collar is a warning or shock-based barrier system that replaces a traditional electric fence's physical wire. Instead, you create your desired perimeter with your phone. SpotOn recommends properties over half an acre because the rechargeable collar needs about 15 feet of warning room before each perimeter—first a low beep, then a brighter beep—to let your dog know to turn around. I have been testing this with my very hare-brained (and thus always wandering) golden retriever, Frank, and it works very well. It lets him know when he's getting too close to somewhere he doesn't need to be. There's even a dog whistle function in the app if you want to give them a command or recall them if they're out of sight on your property. The best part is that you don't have to shock your dog. The SpotOn does come with attachable prongs to make it a shock collar, but you can also just have it rumble. The key is to train your dog properly (read: lots of treats when they hear the noises telling them they are getting near the barrier and return to you). I also like that this collar doesn't require a subscription if you're just using it in barrier mode. You can pay $10 per month for full-time GPS tracking of your dog if you're afraid they'll run off, but it's not required for the collar to work as a virtual fence. I don't trust Frank, so I paid the subscription cost. The big downside? You have to charge it every 24 hours. — Parker Hall $999 at Amazon $999 at Chewy $999 at SpotOn Great Treats Icelandic+ Mini Cod Fish Chips Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Icelandic+ Mini Cod Fish Chips for $10 : Open a bag of these cod fish chips, and your room will immediately be engulfed with a fishiness that will linger in your nostrils for hours. On the other hand, your pup will dart to your room and wolf these down instantly. At least mine did. These are imported from Iceland and are sustainably wild-caught. There are no other ingredients. Vital Essentials Freeze-Dried Raw Treats for $11 : Like the cod fish chips above, there's only one ingredient in Vital Essentials' freeze-dried raw treats. You can choose from several flavors—my dog loves beef tripe—and it's high in protein. Maev Human-Grade Freeze-Dried Treats for $19 : I tried Maev's raw dog food, but my pup didn't love it (the pieces are huge, and you need freezer space to store the large bags). However, he does like the company's freeze-dried treats, which have one ingredient: USDA-certified beef liver. WagWell Treat Party Box for $35 : These freeze-dried treats come in two flavors—beef and cheese—and my dog munched them down quickly as soon as I pulled them out of the bag. There are no other ingredients. You can also buy them separately . Other Dog Accessories We’ve Tested Tavo Dupree II Pet Carrier Photograph: Kat Merck Tavo Dupree II Pet Carrier for $175+ : As anyone who’s driven with a pet in the car can attest, animals don’t always stay put. This can be a hazard for both pets and drivers under normal driving conditions, let alone in the event of an accident. There are pet seatbelts and restraints, but for maximum safety, a pet carrier that can attach to a vehicle’s car seat anchors might be a good option. The Tavo Dupree is from high-end baby car seat maker Nuna , and like its car seats, it meets the United Nations ECE child restraint standards . It can click into your vehicle’s anchor bars and is also airline-compliant as a carry-on that fits under the seat. It’s an extremely sturdy, structured bag with a removable memory foam bed and thoughtful details like an AirTag holder. However, be advised it is for very small pets under 20 pounds only—at 18.5 x 11.5 x 10.25 inches, it was even a tight fit for my small tortoiseshell cat. — Kat Merck Molly Mutt Wool Dog Bed for $99+ : I'm a fan of wool , pretty much wool anything, so when we got a new puppy, it made sense to me to get a wool dog bed. What makes the Molly Mutt wool bed special is the anti-microbial, anti-odor properties of wool. After six months of use, including many days of wet puppy flopping down on this thing to nap, it still doesn't have the slightest bit of odor. I've followed Molly Mutt's suggestion to pull the insert out once a month or so and leave it in direct sunshine, but otherwise, this has been a zero-maintenance bed. We were fortunately that our puppy was housebroken in about a week, but if yours does have an accident, fear not, just pour some water on the insert, leave it in the sun, and it will be dry and odor-free in no time. —Scott Gilbertson Roverlund Ready-to-Roll Cabin Carry-On for $289 : The idea behind this carry-on is that the horizontal shape will allow you to plop your dog's carrier on top, making it easy to travel with them instead of carrying it separately. I tested the carry-on on a recent trip to Kentucky and paired it with Dagne Dover's Kyoto Carrier, and while I like the carry-on itself, the experience wasn't great. The carrier is wider than the carry-on, so my dog tipped over, and the whole thing toppled down. If your pup is smaller, this may work. Roverlund also recommends it with its own carrier, but I have an older version without the luggage strap, so I couldn't use it. However, you can still see in pictures that its updated carrier is wider, so I don't think the outcome would be any different. Still, I think this system works if your dog is 15 pounds or less. I love the bright orange accents inside the carry-on, and there are so many organizational pockets and pouches. It's a great weekender; I was able to fit a whole suit on one side! Grrreen Ellie the Elephant Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Grrreen Dog Toys for $18 : My dog quickly grabbed Grrreen’s dog toys from my hand and particularly enjoyed Ellie the Elephant (it comes in multiple sizes ). These toys are made entirely from recycled polyethylene (rPET), to hopefully reduce the amount of virgin plastics manufactured. The toys have held up decently well in his limited playtime, but my dog also isn't super destructive to his toys, so your mileage may vary. PetSmile Pet Toothpaste for $25 : Every time I go to the vet, they give me a brochure on how to brush my dog's teeth as a silent dig that I really need to brush them more . There are so many dog toothpastes out there, but my dog seems to like Petsmile , specifically the London Broil flavor. Well, he likes the toothpaste, but he hates the brushing part. Petsmile says you don't have to brush, just put some on their teeth and let their tongue do the job, but I brush anyway. It's approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council , but keep in mind that this organization doesn't conduct testing—it reviews data from trials that adhere to VOHC protocols. WagWell Paw Protector for $16 : My dog hates wearing shoes, so we have to forgo them sometimes in the winter. That's when I just apply this balm on his paws for extra protection. It's difficult to say how well it works, but his paws aren't crackly or rough. It's also great for the summer months when the pavement is super hot. It's easy to apply, and a little goes a long way. WagWellies Mojave for $55 : Snow and ice are the main cause of paw-related concerns, but so is hot pavement. We like the WagWellies Mojave, which are like little Crocs for your pups. They come in seven sizes, and the straps around the ankles help the shoe fit better, while the holes keep their toes fresh and breezy. Our tester's dogs haven’t figured out how to walk in shoes, but these stayed on their paws. RifRuf Caesar 1 Dog Sneakers for $75 : Take the trendy, knitted mesh look many humans love, shrink it down, and offer it in six colors for your dog. The sturdy soles protect your dog from the elements, but the knitted body of the shoe can keep their paws cool enough on a regular walk. Our tester dog looked particularly cute in the Taro pair, even if she refused to walk in them. PetSafe Stay & Play Wireless Virtual Pet Fence for $240 : Virtual dog fences aren’t a replacement for real fences. If your dog needs to be fully restrained, get a real fence. However, if your living situation permits a looser barrier, this wireless fence gives you a hassle-free way to partially restrain your dog. Despite the name, this is not really plug-and-play. The device itself is : Just plug it in, set the perimeter distance, and you’re done. But you’re still going to have to train your dog to acknowledge the perimeter and get them used to staying inside the permitted space. Once that’s done, this fence works really well. It’s also portable, so you can take it to a campground or to an Airbnb that permits dogs. PetSafe also makes a more permanent in-ground electronic fence we like even better because it’s cheaper, and setting the perimeter is easier. The trade-off is that you have to bury the wire. The key to success is to train your dog to the fence. Don’t install it and expect your dog to figure it out. Ororo Koldpwoof Heated Dog Vest for $110 : Ororo made a name for itself with its heated jackets, and now it's trying to do the same for dogs. I think a heated dog vest is probably overkill for most people unless you live in exceptionally cold climates or have a short-haired dog that needs the protection. It worked reasonably well (it got warm!), and the battery is easy to operate, but unfortunately, I couldn't properly test it as the smallest size was still too big for my dog. The whole jacket just kept flopping to one side. It's odd because it should fit him OK, considering the size guide on the website. Make sure you check the measurements, and just know that it seems to come oversized. Fable Magic Dog Leash for $70 and Waste Bag Holder for $35 : I think the hands-free leash we recommend above is a better buy for most people (and it's cheaper). I found Fable's Magic Dog Leash a little clunky—the silicone material makes it a little hard to adjust, and the leash just felt a bit too short. Fable also sent me its Waste Bag Holder to test, and I do not think it's anywhere near as easy to use as Earth Rated's Dog Poop Bag Holder.
