When sex toy brand Dame first launched in 2014, its focus was on making no-frills sex toys for people with vulvas . In its quest to close the “pleasure gap,” the company's first product was the Eva —a hands-free clitoral vibrator that could be comfortably worn during penetration thanks to a clever design. A 2015 study of over 1,000 women published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 percent can orgasm through intercourse alone, and 37 percent said clitoral stimulation was necessary for orgasm during intercourse. It might not be a surprise, then, that the Eva became a hit, even before it shipped. Its Indiegogo campaign raised more than $850,000 , one of the most successful crowdfunded sex toys in history. Dame is now trying something different: a sex toy for people with a penis. However, the aptly named Hug wraps around the base of the penis with its adjustable arms, and the other end provides vibrating goodness for the clitoris. It's a sex toy for couples—the best of both worlds. A Ring Unlike Any Other Photograph: Dame I don’t have a penis, but I have sex with those who do. Combined with my 10-plus years covering sexual wellness and sex toys, I can confidently say that I know my way around cock rings and have tried more than my fair share. The Hug doesn't look like any cock ring I’ve seen before. Knowing nothing about Dame, my partner said, \"It looks like it was designed by a woman.” This was by no means an insult, but a compliment. Just looking at the Hug, you can see the consideration that went into the product's design for both the person who will be wearing the Hug and the person who will be enjoying the penis it’s on. As much as I don’t want to do a compare-and-contrast session about cock rings, the Hug has a major standout feature that must be addressed. In a world of silicone cock rings that require either a lot of lube or a flaccid shaft to get it on the penis, the Hug has pinchable arms, so you can easily put it on and take it off at any time, no matter the erection status. Having been with partners who struggled to get cock rings on and/or off, it's a much smarter design. If that wasn't impressive enough, the body of the Hug is shaped to target the clitoris. Clitoral stimulation always feels like an afterthought with most of the cock rings on the market designed to pleasure both partners. Not the case with the Hug. Not only are all five vibration levels tucked into a dome that aligns perfectly with the clitoris, but the Hug is surprisingly flexible, moving with the body effortlessly. You can easily go from missionary to a sitting up position without having to adjust anything. This was something both my partner and I loved. While finagling and readjusting sex toys is sometimes necessary, the Hug was very much in sync with both of our bodies. Near Perfect for Couples Photograph: Dame I consider the Hug a near-perfect sex toy . My partner and I used it multiple times, with my forever-beloved water-based lubricant Bijoux Indiscrets’ Sex au Natural , and each time it floored us both. The Hug felt like a cohesive part of our sexual pleasure and not a third wheel. The Hug takes about two hours to charge and lasts only an hour, but that's not really a bad thing for a cock ring. Blood flow to the penis shouldn’t be restricted for more than 30 minutes. Though thanks to the Hug’s design, you can loosen things up on the penis while keeping the vibrations focused on the clitoris. It's 100 percent waterproof, easy to navigate with its one button, very quiet (not quite whisper-quiet), and USB-C rechargeable. Dame even offers a 3-year warranty. It’s ultimately designed for hetero couples or someone with a penis who’s flying solo and experimenting with erections and blood flow. Which is more than OK! Not every sex toy is geared toward all bodies, all genders, and all sexualities. If it remotely sounds appealing, trust me, the Hug is something you'll want in your sex toy arsenal.
