Best Pixel 9 Case Overall (With MagSafe) dbrand Grip Pixel Cases Read more $60 at Dbrand (9a) Best Thin Pixel 9 Case (With MagSafe) Mous Super Thin MagSafe Case Read more $55 at Amazon (All) Best Cheap Pixel 9 Case Spigen Liquid Air Case Read more $16 at Amazon (9a) Color-Match Your Pixel Google Official Pixel 9 Case Read more $30 $24 at Amazon (9a) Show more 4 / 15 Google says its Pixel 9 smartphones are twice as durable as their predecessors , with Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 enveloping a 100 percent recycled aluminum frame. (The Pixel 9a has an older glass spec, so it's even less durable.) Either way, glass is still glass. There's a good chance even a 4-foot drop from your hand to the pavement will result in a cracked screen. Protect your investment! These Pixels are among the most expensive to date , so it's worth finding a nice case or screen protector to keep them pristine. Fair warning: Having a case on your phone doesn't mean it's invincible. It just reduces the chances of a cracked screen. I've tested a handful to find the best Pixel 9 cases, whether you own the Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL , Pixel 9a , or even the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , and these are my favorites. You'll also find a few handy accessories to round out your new smartphone experience. Read my Best Pixel Phones guide for more tips and recommendations. Note: Pixel 9 cases work with the Pixel 9 Pro, as they have the same dimensions. You'll see manufacturers selling the same case for both. The Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9a cases are often listed separately. Updated April 2025: We've added Latercase, Arc Pulse, UAG Scout, Spigen Thin Fit, Spigen GlasTR screen protector, OtterBox Premium Glass, Nomad ChargeKey V2, and links to the Pixel 9a version of cases we've tested.

Get Your Pixel a Magnetic Case AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Many of the top case recommendations in this guide are MagSafe cases, also just called magnetic cases (or whatever proprietary name the case maker comes up with). It basically means there's a ring of magnets embedded into the case, emulating the MagSafe feature natively found in iPhones . That means your Pixel will suddenly become magnetic, allowing you to take advantage of many of the same MagSafe accessories , from MagSafe power banks to MagSafe wallets . You might not enjoy some benefits of MagSafe like faster wireless charging , but it sure is convenient to place your phone magnetically on a charger instead of hunting for a precise spot. How We Test Cases AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I install every case I recommend in this guide on a Pixel 9 smartphone, ensuring the buttons feel nice and clicky, the holes for the ports, mics, and speakers are accurately cut out, and there are no disruptions to cellular connectivity or wireless charging . With magnetic cases, I try and test the feature with various MagSafe accessories. Unfortunately, I don't do drop tests. There are so many variables, and I have a limited number of devices. In my experience, a protective case can still leave you with a cracked screen. Your best bet is to pair a screen protector and case for maximum protection. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Pixel 9 Case Overall (With MagSafe) dbrand Grip Pixel Cases If you want a traditional case with decently raised edges over the display and a thick bumper that's not slippery, then Dbrand's Grip case is the way to go. This is a MagSafe case, meaning there's a ring of magnets on the back, allowing you to attach your Pixel 9 to various MagSafe accessories like magnetic wireless chargers (your mileage may vary on how well it stays put and charges). I tested it with several MagSafe chargers—the magnets in the case adhered strongly, and my device recharged. It has accurate cutouts for the microphones and speakers, the buttons are super clicky, and the edges around the display and camera bump are raised, keeping those precious elements from touching surfaces. Dbrand has lots of fun designs too, from standard flat colors to one called Toxic Waste. Go crazy! $60 at Dbrand (9a) $60 at Dbrand (9) $60 at Dbrand (9 Pro) $60 at Dbrand (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Thin Pixel 9 Case (With MagSafe) Mous Super Thin MagSafe Case This is one of my favorite Pixel 9 cases. It is a thin case that doesn't offer much durability, but it's great for folks who want something stylish and slim with MagSafe support. The MagSafe connection on this Mous case is pretty strong; I've used it with Peak Design's MagSafe car charger to dock my phone, no clamps required. There's a soft inner layer to protect your phone from scratches, and the polycarbonate case has a soft-touch texture that's pleasant to touch. There are no dedicated buttons on the case—there's a recessed gap for the Pixel 9's buttons, which means they don't protrude. I suggest pairing this case with a screen protector—my wife did this and promptly dropped her phone through an above-ground subway track onto the street below (about two stories). Her phone survived fine. $55 at Amazon (All) $50 at Mous (9/9 Pro) $50 at Mous (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Cheap Pixel 9 Case Spigen Liquid Air Case Spigen's Liquid Air is a longtime favorite because it looks elegant and feels nice despite costing so little. If you don't want to spend much but want some protection, this case should cover your bases for basic dings and scratches. The edges around the screen are raised, meaning the display won't touch a surface, and the buttons are satisfying to press. There's even some texture on the power button, making it easy to distinguish. $16 at Amazon (9a) $17 at Amazon (9/9 Pro) $16 at Amazon (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Color-Match Your Pixel Google Official Pixel 9 Case You bought your phone from Google, so why not the case as well? Google's official Pixel 9 case is affordable and simple and lets you precisely color-match your phone. Seriously, don't hide that beautiful pink or wintergreen Pixel 9—or even the iris or peony Pixel 9a—in a boring black case. The camera bump all but disappears with this case installed on the flagship Pixels, and I like the metallic buttons. The screen is well-protected, and the silicone is nice and soft. A microfiber lining keeps the back of your Pixel scratch-free. Google says this case's polycarbonate shell is made with 75 percent recycled plastic, though the entire case is made with at least 42 percent recycled materials. Of the few cases I tested for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold , Google's official case is my favorite. (Though I prefer going case-less completely.) It's thin and lightweight, though don't expect much protection from steep drops. $30 $24 at Amazon (9a) $35 at Amazon (9/9 Pro/XL) $39 at Amazon (Fold) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best for Mounting (With MagSafe) Peak Design Everyday Case If you're frequently affixing your phone to something, say, a bike handlebar or electric scooter, then look at Peak Design's Everyday Case. Its SlimLink tech leverages Apple's MagSafe technology and is my favorite mounting system, though it requires you to use the company's case with its accessories , like the Universal Bar Mount . It adds more security to the mount so your Pixel won't fly off when you ride over a pothole, and yet it's easy to remove the phone from the mount with a single button press. I prefer the version without the finger loop, but this case has clicky buttons, a thick bumper, and a pleasant fabriclike texture on the back. $50 at Peak Design $50 at Amazon Photograph: Julian Chokkattu For Case Haters Arc Pulse I've tested Arc's metal bumpers a few times, and I'm always surprised how much I like them. They feel like they won't do anything to stop a crack—and they might not if your phone hits an edge that's not protected—but it somehow still feels substantial and elegant. (You can also watch Arc's drop test videos to feel a little better about going with something so bare.) It's easy to install, though removing the top piece can take a little force. The aluminum bumpers have never come off by themselves. I especially like how the Pixel 9 camera bar is protected too. It's a good look if you haven't yelped at the price. $70 at Arc (9/Pro) $90 at Arc (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Another Great MagSafe Case Mous Limitless 5.0 MagSafe Case The Mous Limitless 5.0 is nearly identical to Dbrand’s Grip—even the MagSafe strength is similar—but I'd say the Dbrand is slightly grippier, and it has more designs to choose from. That said, Mous also has different styles, like speckled fabric or a walnut back. The case doesn't add much bulk and makes the camera bump flush with the back of the phone. The buttons are responsive, there's a spot to attach a lanyard, and the cutouts for all the ports are spot-on. $75 at Amazon $70 at Mous Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Screen Protector dbrand Prism 2.0 Pixel 9 Series Tempered Glass When I first tested this screen protector, I had to freehand the installation, but I surprisingly was able to line it up perfectly on two Pixel 9 models. Now, the company sells it with an “idiot-proof” application tool that resembles the ones I've used from brands like Smartish, and it's even easier to apply. That does mean the price has gone up a bit. The tempered glass covers the entirety of the display, and it even protects the selfie camera. (I haven't noticed any issues with the Pixel 9's face unlock or selfie photos.) It's not obvious that it's installed either, with smooth edges that don't stick out. You get two screen protectors in the box, dust removal stickers, alcohol wipes, and a microfiber cloth. There's a squeegee tool to remove air bubbles. $35 at Dbrand (9a) $35 at Dbrand (9) $35 at Dbrand (9 Pro) $35 at Dbrand (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Protection OtterBox Commuter Series Pixel 9 Case OtterBox's Commuter Series is the classic case that strikes an excellent balance between design, bulk, and protection. You get two pieces: a rubber slipcover that first goes over the Pixel and then a polycarbonate hardshell that attaches to the exterior. It feels sturdy and strong, with clicky buttons, and the USB-C charging port is covered, too. Wireless charging still works fine. It's made with more than 35 percent recycled plastic. $40 $30 at Amazon (All) $40 at OtterBox (9a) $40 at OtterBox (9/9 Pro) $40 at OtterBox (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Clear Pixel Case (With MagSafe) Spigen Ultra Hybrid Metal Ring MagFit Case Spigen's clear case lets your Pixel's design shine through, but with any clear case, you'll have to be wary of smudges. It's still a feature-packed case, with responsive buttons and a lanyard attachment point, but the best part is the MagSafe ring on the back that enables magnetic functionality. (If you don't care for it and want a pure clear case, Spigen's Ultra Hybrid is a good option .) The UAG Plyo Pro ($50) is another good clear case, though the MagSafe connector is much thicker, so perhaps it's not as clear as you might want. It's also heftier, with more bulk around the edges, but that might make it a bit more protective than the Spigen. $19 at Amazon (9a) $22 at Amazon (9/9 Pro) $22 at Amazon (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu An Eco-Friendly Case Pela Case Pela has long been synonymous with eco-friendly—its cases are made from flax shive and a plant-based biopolymer, and they're 100 percent compostable. The company prioritizes ethical manufacturing and is a Certified B Corp , meaning a third party has vetted its claims. Pela's Pixel 9 cases are wonderfully soft and surprisingly grippy. There's an indent to access the power button, which makes it easy to distinguish it from the volume rocker. (The rocker is quite responsive.) The edges around the camera module and display are raised enough to protect those surfaces. Best of all, Pela can go toe-to-toe with the likes of Casetify in the sheer amount of designs you can choose from. The only thing I will note is that some of these designs can feel a bit sticky on the back. $65 at Pela (9a) $65 at Pela (9/9 Pro) $65 at Pela (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Snazzy Wireless Charger Nomad Stand (Qi2) Google no longer sells its Pixel Stand wireless charger, but this one from Nomad is a great alternative. It's important to note that this wireless charger will only work if you use a MagSafe case . Many cases we recommend have the magnetic connector that will allow you to attach the Pixel to this charger and recharge. Again, it will not work without a MagSafe case . If you don't have one of those and don't plan on buying one, a simple wireless charging stand like this one from Spigen will do the trick just fine. The best part is this charger supports the Qi2 standard , so there's some future-proofing here as the Pixel 10 and beyond will likely support the standard, and you'll be ahead of the curve. Read our Best Wireless Chargers guide for more. $99 at Nomad Photograph: Simon Hill Keep Your Battery Recharged Nimble Champ (Series 2) The Pixel 9 series has solid battery life across the board, even the Pixel 9a, but none of these devices will take you through a second day on a single charge. It's a good idea to keep a portable battery charger around just in case, and Nimble's Champ Series 2 is our favorite. You can choose from different capacities—the bigger the battery, the more times you can recharge your phone before needing to top up the battery. These come with a bright lanyard loop for easy toting, and Nimble uses bioplastics (90 percent recycled plastic) and plastic-free packaging to reduce the environmental impact where possible. You get a USB-C cable in the box. $24 at Amazon (Small) $30 $24 at Nimble (Small) $60 $55 at Amazon (Medium) $60 at Nimble (Medium) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Slim Charging Adapter Nomad 65W Slim Power Adapter The Pixel 9 series can charge faster than ever, but each model charges at specific speeds. The Pixel 9a charges at 23 watts, the Pixel 9 charges at 27 watts, the Pixel 9 Pro charges at 30 watts, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL charges at 37 watts. While the first two can recharge up to 55 percent in 30 minutes, the Pro XL can recharge up to 70 percent. Google says to achieve those speeds on its largest phone, you'll need to use its 45-watt charging adapter, which I have not yet tried. Instead, you can get a reasonably fast charge with something as slim and lightweight as Nomad's 65-watt charger. This thing is my go-to charger, which I take everywhere, because the prongs fold up flat and it has enough power to juice up a MacBook Pro. There are also two USB-C ports, and if you have two devices plugged in, it will divvy up 45 watts to the left port and 20 watts to the right one. That's plenty for most personal devices. $65 at Nomad Photograph: Julian Chokkattu For Battery Emergencies Nomad ChargeKey V2 When your Pixel is about to die, this little gizmo can save it. I keep it on my keychain at all times, and it acts as a very tiny USB-C to USB-C cable. Plug one end into your phone and the other into another USB-C source, like a laptop, PC, charging adapter, or even a friend's phone, and you can get your device enough juice to tide you over. (Make sure you choose the charging settings on your Pixel when it pops up and ensure you're not charging the other device.) It supports up to 240 watts of fast charging, which means you can use it to charge a laptop if you have a powerful enough charging source. The two USB-C connectors magnetically stick together, so it doesn't dangle much on a keychain. $25 at Nomad (V2) $25 at Amazon (V1) Other Good Cases and Accessories The world of Pixel accessories grows every year. Here are a few other cases I've tried and liked, just not as much as the ones above. Spigen Tough Armor Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Spigen Rugged Armor and Tough Armor for $20+ : These cases are also available for the Pixel 9 Pro XL . Interestingly, the Pixel 9a version of Rugged Armor and Tough Armor features MagSafe magnets on the back, allowing you to use the phone with magnetic accessories (it worked on a Qi2 charger ). The cases for the rest of the Pixel 9 series do not have magnets. The Rugged Armor has a nice textured back and grippy edges, though these areas tend to attract smudges and marks. The edges are nicely raised to protect the screen and cameras, and the buttons are clicky. The Tough Armor, on the other hand, is smoother and has a kickstand on the back. Annoyingly, this kickstand only works for landscape orientation, so it's not the case to buy if you watch a lot of TikTok. OtterBox Defender Series for $55 : This is arguably the most protective case for the Pixel 9 series. It has a hard shell that splits into two pieces, wrapping around the front and back of the phone, and you click them in place. Then add the rubber slipcover over the top and the holster, which lets you affix the phone to the belt. The holster's clip can also double as a kickstand in a horizontal orientation. Even the USB-C charging port is covered up. I think the OtterBox Commuter I recommend above gets you nearly there in terms of durability, but if you want to maximize protection and like holsters, go for the Defender. UAG Tempered Glass Screen Protector for $35 : This tempered glass screen protector (also available for the Pixel 9 Pro XL ) was very easy to install. It comes with an applicator tool, a wet wipe, a dust removal sticker, and a microfiber cloth. The Dbrand I recommend above is a better value because you get two in the box, and it's cheaper, but UAG's option is a solid alternative. Pela Liquid Screen Protector for $30 : I'm cautiously optimistic about this one because I haven't had much experience with liquid screen protectors. Pela sends a little vial with this liquid magic inside. First, clean your phone with a microfiber cloth. Then, pour a third of the contents in the vial onto the cloth, and wipe the phone down. Wait two minutes, and then wipe away any excess. This liquid supposedly protects from scratches, drops, and even impact, and is oleophobic to reduce smudges. You'll need to reapply it every 12 months, so save the rest that's in the vial. I'll report back if I have any issues. The good thing is Pela will pay for any screen repairs, provided you were using a Pela case and this liquid screen protector simultaneously. OtterBox Google Pixel 9a Premium Glass Screen Protector for $40 : I tested this on the Pixel 9a, but it's available for the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro XL. You only get one tempered glass screen protector, but the box turns into the applicator tool, and OtterBox includes a wet wipe, a microfiber cloth, and dust stickers. I always find that the tab you're supposed to attach the protector to doesn't always connect properly. Still, my installation was accurate with no air bubbles. Spigen Thin Fit Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Spigen Thin Fit Case for $17 : If you want to spend as little as possible on a case but still want MagSafe functionality, this Spigen case will do the trick. But I must warn you, this is the most generic phone case you'll find. Functionally, I have no qualms about the thing. But it's plain, boring, and feels like a crime to cover up my Pixel's pretty color. It's also available for the Pixel 9a and Pixel 9 Pro XL . Spigen GlasTR Tempered Glass Screen Protector (2 Pack) for $19 : I tested this screen protector for the Pixel 9a , but it's also available for the Pixel 9 Pro XL . I initially screwed up my first application—when I removed the back adhesive, the protector misaligned slightly, causing it to install slightly askew on the phone. Good thing it comes with a spare. Things were much smoother the second time around, though both times I was left with a lot of air bubbles. Spigen includes a big squeegee to get rid of them, which is nice. OtterBox Symmetry Series for $31 : This is a perfectly fine case that's just a bit unremarkable. The buttons are easy to press, the cutouts are accurate, and there's good protection from the raised edges. It's just not unique in how it looks and doesn't offer any other interesting features. UAG Pathfinder MagSafe Case for $55 : This was a weird one. I like this case, even with its somewhat rugged look. But the MagSafe did not work at all on the Pro XL case . I suspect I got a dud because I tested the same case for the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro , and magnetic wireless charging worked perfectly. Outside of this blip, this case offers clicky buttons and lots of indents for a satisfying grip. The cutouts are accurate, and the lips are raised decently on the display, though they could stand to be more protective of the camera module. UAG Scout Case for $30 : I tested this case for the Pixel 9a, and it's rather unremarkable. I'm not a fan of the odd rectangular bump on the back, and I don't find it all that grippy. There are no magnets either. But the buttons are clicky, with raised edges around the screen and accurate port cutouts. You can also get it for the Pixel 9/9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL . Latercase Thin Case Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Latercase Thin Case for $59 : As soon as I popped this case on the Pixel 9a, I could see smudges from my fingers on the back, and it put me off. I spent a few seconds wiping it down, and after some time, the smudges came back. The aramid fiber texture seems to attract ’em. It’s a thin case designed for people who hate thick cases, but I find it a little dull, and there are no magnets inside, so no access to magnetic accessories. The top, bottom, and right edge with the buttons are also exposed, so it isn't doing much. Check out the other colors, though. It doesn't look bad in crimson. Thinborne Aramid Fiber Super Thin Case for $70 : This case isn't for drop protection because it's incredibly thin. It's a nice option if you hate cases but want to protect your device from scratches. That said, it's really difficult to take it off (unless you have long nails). It also smudges way too easily, so I constantly found myself wiping it down. There's a MagSafe magnetic ring baked in, but it struggled to reliably adhere to other MagSafe accessories—the magnets just aren't strong enough. At least you do get a screen protector in the box, though you need to freehand the installation. Casetify Impact Case With MagSafe for $52 : Casetify has an endless number of designs you can choose from, and while it has come under fire for how it acquires some of those designs , there are not many places you can go to get a Pixel 9 case with Spider-Man on the back or one that makes your phone look like a film camera . These cases have MagSafe rings inside, so they should work with most MagSafe accessories. I just don't love how prominent the Casetify logo is on the back. Avoid These Cases OtterBox Thin Flex Series Photograph: Julian Chokkattu OtterBox Thin Flex Series for $41 : As soon as I installed this svelte case, I started trying all the buttons. The power button is not blocked by the case, but the volume rocker is, and unfortunately, it is incredibly hard to press. Or rather, it's not that it's hard to press, it's that you barely feel anything when you press the rocker, which is just as frustrating. It's an otherwise solid case, though the edges by the hinge are a bit sharp. UAG Plyo Pixel 9 Pro Fold Case for $60 : Nothing about this case screams $60. It feels cheap, and I hate that the left edge on the front has so much flex. The edges around the screen are also comically large, and I also found it hard to access the phone's buttons. It's not great. Julian Chokkattu is a senior reviews editor at WIRED, and has been covering personal technology and reviewing consumer products for nearly a decade.
