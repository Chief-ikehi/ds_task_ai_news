  "full_content": "Save this story Save Save this story Save The United States Department of Homeland Security sent an email this week informing people living in the US on a temporary legal status that their “parole” has been revoked and instructed them to leave the country “immediately.” However, the email was also addressed to at least one US citizen, an immigration attorney from Massachusetts. And it remains unclear who must abide by the email's instructions—or why the apparent revocation of legal immigration status was delivered via email at all. The email informs the recipient that “DHS is now exercising its discretion to terminate your parole,” which it says will go into effect “7 days from the date of this notice.” The email appears to be similar, if not identical, to messages received by users of CBP One , an app developed during the Biden administration that allows noncitizens from certain countries to schedule appointments at US points of entry in an effort to seek asylum. A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tells WIRED, however, that the email was sent more broadly. “CBP has issued notices terminating parole for individuals who do not have lawful status to remain,” says CBP assistant commissioner for public affairs Hilton Beckham. “This process is not limited to CBP One users and does not currently apply to those paroled under programs such as U4U and OAW.” U4U refers to Uniting for Ukraine, a program launched under the Biden administration to allow for expedited immigration to the US for Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s war against its neighboring country. Former President Joe Biden began OAW, or Operation Allies Welcome, in 2021 following the US military’s exit from Afghanistan to allow for the safe resettling of “vulnerable Afghans, including those who worked alongside us in Afghanistan for the past two decades,” according to DHS . The email itself does not identify these or any other exemptions, nor does it make clear to whom it applies beyond the recipient. Beckham also confirmed that the email was sent to whatever email address the agency had associated with the intended target, leading to confusion for at least one immigration attorney. “Some personal news: the Department of Homeland Security has given me, an immigration lawyer born in Newton, Massachusetts, seven days to leave the US,” wrote Nicole Micheroni, a partner at  Cameron Micheroni & Silvia, in a post on Bluesky on Friday night. “Does anyone know if you can get Italian citizenship through great-grandparents?” Micheroni tells WIRED that she first thought the email was intended for one of her clients, but she quickly noticed that it was only addressed to her. “I don't feel like I'm actually going to be deported in seven days, but it's concerning that this is the level of care they're using to send these out,” Micheroni says. She adds that it’s possible that the DHS email was “intended for one of my clients or somebody else,” as it’s not uncommon for immigrants in the US to list their attorneys as the point of contact.

The Trump administration has sought to revoke the parole of some 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who entered the US under a Biden-era humanitarian parole program. While it moved to subject them to expedited deportation effective April 24, on Thursday a federal judge in Boston said she would issue a protective order blocking that attempt. However, CBP's Beckham says people covered by the order did not receive the email, which stipulates that it does not apply to people who “have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain” in the US. “Thursday’s order pertains to the CHNV program, a categorical parole that was not sent termination notices,” Beckham says. “Aliens from those countries who did not enter through the CHNV program may have been subject to the termination notices.” Attorney Lauren Regan, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Civil Liberties Defense Center, tells WIRED that the lack of clarity about whether the revocation of temporary parole applies to the recipient of the email is likely causing fear and confusion among many immigrants, especially those without access to adequate legal guidance. “So many people don’t have a lawyer, or their lawyer has 6,000 clients,” Regan says, which “completely overloads” the attorneys who often provide pro bono legal services to immigrants. “A lot of people that are here on parole status don't know the nuances of immigration law, so they get this email and they don't know if it applies to them,” Micheroni says. “And most of them assume that it does because everything is really scary for people right now.” It’s also unclear whether the email is related to recent efforts by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ). In an April 10 post on X, DOGE claimed that “CBP identified a subset of 6.3k individuals paroled into the United States since 2023 on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center watchlist or with criminal records. These paroles have since been terminated with immediate effect.” Beckham did not immediately respond to questions about whether the email was intended for these 6,300 individuals, nor did she answer WIRED’s questions about how many people received the email. Then there’s the matter of the email being an email at all. Regan says that “it is absolutely not common” for a change in legal immigration status to arrive via email, which typically happens in person or via certified mail. “People would think it’s a phishing email or something not legitimate,” Regan says. Also, the fact that the email does not appear to have been first posted on a government website added to questions about its authenticity. “Normally if the government is going to change a practice, they would first do it on their websites,” Regan says, adding, “but the fact that this was not on the website first and then sent out as a direct communication is very, very unusual.” Regan also notes that many immigrants do not have email addresses, and therefore couldn’t receive the communication in the first place. Even for Micheroni, a US citizen and immigration attorney, the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement practices have made life less stable. The email only made matters worse. “I have gotten some serious inquiries from my parents or other family members or friends being like, ‘what do I do if you stop answering me or if you disappear? Like, who do you want me to call?’” she says. “And if people in my life are feeling this way, and this is what I do, I know a lot about it,” Micheroni adds. “I can't imagine what it's like for people that don't fully understand immigration law.” Updated at 4 pm ET: Added additional comment from CBP clarifying that Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who entered the US under the so-called CHNV program did not receive the email.",
