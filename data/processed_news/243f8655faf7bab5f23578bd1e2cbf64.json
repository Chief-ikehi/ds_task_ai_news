But chances are there's a smartphone that comes close to what you're looking for. From the bottomless pit of phone choices, these are my favorite Android handsets, including the Google Pixel 9a , WIRED's top pick. All the phones we've selected have advantages, and I've laid them out as best as possible based on extensive testing. See our other mobile buying guides for more, like the Best iPhones , Best Cheap Phones , Best Samsung Phones , Phones With a Headphone Jack , Best Pixel Phones , and Best Folding Phones .

Is Now a Good Time to Buy? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Yes. Many of the phones in this guide are the latest models we've tested, but more importantly, there's a strong chance that prices of electronics like smartphones, laptops, and tablets will start creeping up over the coming months due to the heavy China tariffs . It's an evolving situation, but it's smart to buy a new smartphone now (if you need to upgrade), instead of waiting and ending up having to pay an absurd price. Buy an Unlocked Phone AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We recommend unlocked phones in this guide. When a phone is sold as unlocked, that means it can be used on multiple wireless carriers and networks. When you buy a phone directly from your wireless carrier, usually on a payment plan, it often comes locked to that network. Carriers are legally required to unlock a phone upon request so you can switch networks, but it's a big hassle. Try to pay full price for your phone, or make sure it specifically says it's unlocked. Buy it from the manufacturer directly, or investigate your carrier's policies for unlocking phones if they're bought on a payment plan that requires you to use its network. It's less of a hassle when you travel and want to switch to an international SIM card too. Android Specs to Look For AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron If none of the smartphones in this guide strike your fancy and you want to keep looking, here are a couple of things to keep in mind as you shop. Display size : You hold a smartphone all the time, so make sure whatever you pick is the right size for your palms. Most small Android phones are around 6.1 to 6.3 inches (measured diagonally), whereas larger phones typically top out at 6.8 or 6.9 inches. Processor : Most smartphones are powered by a Qualcomm or MediaTek processor. Google phones use the company's in-house Tensor chip, and some Samsung phones utilize Samsung's Exynos processor in select markets. It's difficult to say how reliably a processor will perform without looking at reviews and benchmark results, so do your research. If you're after reliable performance, try to stick to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7 series or higher, or MediaTek's Dimensity 7000 series or higher. RAM : You'll at the very least want a phone with 6 GB of RAM, though 8 GB would be better. This will let you juggle multiple apps much more seamlessly. If you want to future-proof your device, opting for 12 or 16 GB will likely allow you to better access new and upcoming artificial intelligence features, though it depends on the manufacturer and how well they support their devices. Cooling : Good-performing phones can be ruined if they get too hot because then the processor gets throttled, causing slowdowns. This mostly applies to folks who game a lot, but it's worth checking whether there's a dedicated cooling system on the phone. You'll want to look for language like “heat pipes” or “vapor chamber cooling.” Refresh rate : Most phones used to come with 60-Hz refresh rates, meaning the display refreshed 60 frames per second. Nowadays, even cheap phones offer 90- or 120-Hz screens. The more frames refreshed in a second, the more fluid everything looks and feels. It might sound small, but it can make a big difference in your smartphone feeling buttery smooth. We have a broader guide that explains this technology further. Flagship phones have screens with variable refresh rates that range from 1 to 120 Hz, meaning they're often more battery efficient. Battery capacity : Smartphone batteries are measured in milliampere-hours (mAh). A big battery doesn't necessarily mean better battery life, because much depends on the size of the screen and other technologies the phone is powering. That said, most phones should have 4,000-mAh cells or higher, and you typically won't see anything higher than 5,500 mAh. Some phones now have silicon-carbon batteries, a new technology that allows them to be denser but thinner—the OnePlus 13, for example, has a 6,000-mAh battery but is slimmer than many of its peers. Charging speeds : Most Android smartphones can charge fast, but certain companies offer shockingly fast recharge times. That's usually because they have a proprietary charging brick you'll need to use. You can find charging speed information on a phone's product spec page. OnePlus phones are famous for recharging fully within around 30 minutes. Just remember that these days, most smartphones do not come with a charging brick, just a cable. We have more details in this fast charging guide . Software updates : Software support is crucial. It means your phone will stay secure for longer and you'll get new features over time. The gold standard in Android is 7 years right now, thanks to Samsung and Google. However, if you have a cadence of replacing your phone every two or three years, then the lesser update policies of other Android phone makers might not be as big of a deal to you. Cameras : Camera specs are very misleading. A phone with a 108-megapixel sensor doesn't mean it will take better photos than a phone with a 50-MP sensor. The only way to really know is to look at reviews. What you can do, if the camera is important to you, is check if there's a versatile system. The best camera phones offer a primary wide camera, an ultrawide, and a telephoto zoom (usually at 5X zoom). That said, cheap phones tend to come with a lot of cameras, many of which are useless. Extra features : It's important not to overlook the smaller features you may expect. Does the phone have a near-field communication sensor (NFC) so you can make contactless payments? Does it have a good IP rating that can survive a drop in the pool? Is there wireless charging? What about a microSD card slot or headphone jack ? Make sure you vet the phone's tech specs if you're after something specific. 5G service : Most new smartphones support 5G now , the current generation of network connectivity. If the phone you're looking at doesn't support 5G—don't fret! 4G LTE isn't going anywhere yet. Don't feel pressured to upgrade to a 5G phone. That said, you do need a 5G-enabled smartphone if you want to make use of 5G speeds. It's available in phones as cheap as $200. How to Switch Between Phones AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The best way to switch phones is to follow the setup prompts when you first boot up your new device—make sure you transfer data from an old phone via a cable. It's much faster than doing it wirelessly, though that's an option too. Some manufacturers, like Samsung, will suggest you download a proprietary data transfer app on your old device, like Smart Switch , and you should. It means less work for you—whether it's fewer apps you need to sign into or fewer icons you need to rearrange. If you're coming from an iPhone, you can use Google's official Android Switch app , though it's not necessary if you are switching to a Samsung phone . Check out our tips on setting up your new Android phone for more , and our steps on how to back up an Android and how to factory reset it . How We Test Smartphones AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I put my personal SIM card in every smartphone I test, and typically use it for a week, if not two or three. I stress test performance by playing mobile games and running benchmark tests, and I often do camera testing by bringing a competing phone along and analyzing photos side by side on a larger, more color-accurate screen. I've been reviewing smartphones for close to a decade—not just the flagship devices either. I'm always testing cheap phones to see what innovations are trickling down. The Best Android Phone Overall Google Pixel 9a For several years, Google's Pixel A-series phones have been our number one smartphone choice for most people. Why? Because you get almost everything you'd want for half the price of a flagship. You don't need to spend north of $500 for a good phone. The Pixel 9a continues this trend ( 9/10, WIRED Recommends ). The 120-Hz OLED screen gets bright, the 5,100-mAh battery comfortably lasts a full day, and the top-end Tensor G4 chipset delivers flagship-grade performance. Pixels are known for their great cameras, and the dual-camera system here doesn't disappoint. Topping all that off are perks like Qi wireless charging, secure face unlock, an IP68 water resistance rating , and seven years of software support—it's a no-brainer. This phone has almost all the features of the premium Pixel 9 series (see below), even some fun new camera features like Add Me and Best Take . However, because it only has 8 GB of RAM, you won't be able to access the new Pixel Screenshots app or Call Notes, which provides a text summary of your phone calls. Still, you're left with a bevy of smart features that are genuinely helpful day-to-day, from Google's excellent Call Screen technology that keeps spam calls at bay to Magic Eraser. Specs Display: 6.3-inch, 120-Hz, OLED Processor and RAM: Tensor G4 with 8 GB RAM Storage: 128- and 256-GB options Battery: 5,100 mAh Cameras: 48-MP main camera, 13-MP ultrawide, 13-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): 7 years of software updates Extras: Qi wireless charging, IP68, fingerprint and secure face unlock, NFC Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks $499 at Amazon $499 at Google Store Photograph: Julian Chokkattu The Smartest Smartphones Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL Google's Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL ( 9/10, WIRED Recommends ) are the smartest Android phones. From instant transcriptions and summaries of recordings and calls to finding information from a long-lost screenshot you captured ages ago, these phones are chock-full of AI features that make a small difference in day-to-day use. These flagships are Google's most polished models to date, with a sleek new pill-shaped camera visor, a flat display, and flat edges for easier grip. They share the same features across both sizes, save for screen and battery size. The Pixel 9 Pro XL will last a bit longer, but neither phone will get much more than a day with heavy use. The Pixel 9 Pro series has a vapor chamber cooling system that dissipates heat better, so you can run graphics-intensive games for longer periods without running into stutters or dealing with a super hot phone. But it's the cameras and photos that really make them shine. From the 5X optical zoom to the 42-MP selfie camera, you'll be satisfied with the results, as they deliver some of the best mobile photography. You can take things further by employing Google's AI camera features , like Reimagine, which lets you type text to generate things into existing images. Add a large moon in the background of your photo, make it look like it was raining, or change the lighting to golden hour. It's scary how good it is. You can find more details in our dedicated Google Pixel Phone buying guide and our review , but the Pixel 9 Pro models have an excellent blend of smart software, polished hardware, and brawny internals that make them an easy recommendation to anyone looking to spend this much on a smartphone. Specs Display: 6.3-inch and 6.8-inch, 120-Hz LTPO, OLED Processor and RAM: Tensor G4 with 16 GB RAM Storage: 128-GB, 256-GB, 512-GB, and 1-TB options Battery: 4,700 and 5,060 mAh Cameras: 50-MP wide, 48-MP ultrawide, 48-MP telephoto (5X), 42-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): 7 years of software updates Extras: Qi wireless charging, IP68, fingerprint and secure face unlock, NFC, VPN, Video Boost, Google One AI Premium Plan Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks $999 $749 at Amazon (Pro) $1,099 $687 at Amazon (XL) $999 at Target (Pro) $1,099 at Target (XL) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Flagship Phones Samsung Galaxy S25, S25+, S25 Ultra Samsung's smartphones are the crème de la crème of the Android world, with top specs, refined hardware, and excellent software support. None of that has changed with the new Galaxy S25 series ( 7/10, WIRED Recommends ), but that's mostly because they're not too different from their predecessor . Outside of the usual spec changes, the phones are largely unchanged, and Samsung instead emphasized artificial intelligence. The best part of the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25+, and Galaxy S25 Ultra is the chipset and heat management—the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite is a powerful chip, and combined with improved cooling mechanisms, there's a noticeable improvement when playing demanding games for lengthy periods (the phone doesn't get super hot fast and games, which in turn means games don't stutter as frequently). The big AI features fall a little flat. It's nice that Gemini is now the default assistant instead of Samsung's Bixby (which still exists), but the new features are not all that impactful. Samsung's wireless charging implementation is more annoying—the phones support Qi2 but do not have magnets built in. Officially, they're “ Qi2 Ready ,” which means you need a magnetic case (we've rounded up our favorites here ) to enable it. Even with the lackluster improvements, it's hard to be dissatisfied with these devices when they excel in every category, from stunning AMOLED displays to versatile cameras and day-long battery life. The Galaxy S25 is a fantastic compact size, and the Galaxy S25+ matches it in features but sizes up. The S25 Ultra doesn't feel as Ultra anymore, but you still get a more durable build, an extra 5X optical zoom camera, and the S Pen stylus. Check out our Best Samsung Galaxy Phones guide for more details. Specs Display: 6.2-inch, 6.7-inch, 6.9-inch, 120-Hz LTPO, AMOLED Processor and RAM: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite with 12 GB of RAM Storage: 128-GB, 256-GB, 512-GB, and 1-TB options Battery: 4,000, 4,900, and 5,000 mAh Cameras: S25 and S25+ have a 50-MP main camera, 12-MP ultrawide, 10-MP telephoto, and 12-MP selfie cameras | S25 Ultra has a 200-MP main, 50-MP ultrawide, 10-MP telephoto (3X), 50-MP telephoto (5X), and 12-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): 7 years of software updates Extras: Qi2 Ready wireless charging (with magnetic case), IP68, fingerprint unlock, NFC, S Pen stylus integrated on S25 Ultra Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks $800 $720 at Amazon (S25) $1,000 $899 at Amazon (S25)+ $1,300 $1,100 at Amazon (Ultra) $800 at Samsung (All) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu If Battery Life Is Your Priority OnePlus 13 OnePlus has always been the flagship Android smartphone I recommend for anyone not interested in a Samsung or Google device. The company has focused on innovating in the battery and charging space to stand out—the OnePlus 13 is the only phone in the US that can go from zero to 100 percent in a mere 36 minutes, provided you use the included charger. It is also one of the few phones with a silicon-carbon battery, providing greater power density without increasing thickness. (It has a whopping 6,000-mAh battery and is thinner than the OnePlus 12 , which has a smaller cell!) It's a shame there's no Qi2 wireless charging here , which would have introduced a magnetic charging system like Apple's MagSafe, though OnePlus does sell official cases with magnets embedded inside for a similar experience . You can choose between the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends )—the latter is cheaper ($600) and isn't as feature-rich, nor does it have the same high-end specs. You can make do with the OnePlus 13R just fine, but I don't find it as good a value over the OnePlus 12R from 2024. Go for the OnePlus 13 instead. The display isn't as curvy as before, making it easier to grip, there's flagship-worthy water resistance of IP68/69, and performance is excellent. Battery life is roughly two days with average use, or about a day if you use the phone for many tasks. The triple-camera system is also pretty great. I routinely used the 3X camera and was very happy with my results. It's not the best camera system, but it's fun to use and slick, plus I like the Hasselblad-tuned filters. Specs Display: 6.82-inch 120-Hz LTPO, OLED Processor and RAM: Snapdragon 8 Elite with 12 GB RAM (up to 16 GB RAM) Storage: 256 GB and 512 GB Battery: 6,000 mAh Cameras: 50-MP main camera, 50-MP telephoto (3X), 50-MP ultrawide, and 32-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): Four OS upgrades, 6 years of software updates Extras: Qi wireless charging, IP68/69, fingerprint unlock, NFC, and fast charging with the proprietary charger Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks $900 at OnePlus $1,000 $900 at Best Buy (512 GB) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Under $400 Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro If you want a well-rounded smartphone but don't want to pay exorbitant prices, consider the latest from UK-based Nothing. The Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro are its sub-$500 Android phones, and they are both fantastic ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ). They're identical in every way except the cameras, where the Pro model has a slight advantage in zoom and low-light capabilities. I think the Phone (3a) looks nicer and is a better value. Run through the list of specs and you'll be hard-pressed to find fault with the hardware. The display is wonderfully smooth with its 120-Hz refresh rate, and it's no struggle to see in the sun. Performance is snappy, battery life is reliable, and the camera quality is decent for the money. Nothing is even promising longer software updates than ever before. I appreciate Nothing's infusion of artificial intelligence too—the physical Essential Key button lets you record notes via text or voice, and AI will summarize these notes and turn them into actionable tasks. There are some drawbacks—these phones are only IP64-rated, so don't drop them in the pool. There's no wireless charging, either. You also need to sign up for a beta program in the US to buy them, which isn't a huge deal, but this is because connectivity isn't as seamless. While it'll work best on T-Mobile, you'll only get 4G on Verizon and AT&T until you ask the carriers to white-list the device for 5G access. That process is sure to be frustrating. Specs Display: 6.77 inch, AMOLED LTPS, 120 Hz Processor and RAM: Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 with 12 GB of RAM Storage: 256 GB Battery: 5,000 mAh Cameras: Phone (3a) has a 50-MP main, 8-MP ultrawide, 50-MP telephoto (2X optical), 32-MP selfie camera | Phone (3a) Pro has a 50-MP main, 8-MP ultrawide, 50-MP telephoto (3X optical), 50-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): Three OS upgrades, 6 years of security updates Extras: 50-watt fast charging, IP64, NFC Carrier compatibility: Works on T-Mobile. 4G works on AT&T and Verizon, but you need to contact the carriers to white-list the device for 5G $379 at Nothing $459 at Nothing (Pro) $499 at Amazon (Pro) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Under $300 Motorola Moto G Power (2025) Motorola’s 2025 Moto G Power ( 7/10, WIRED Recommends ) isn't as great as its predecessor, and that comes down to one reason: Due to a lesser chipset, there's a slight hit in performance, and it feels a bit more sluggish to use. However, the performance is good enough that you won’t feel frustrated. Outside of this, it's a remarkable $300 phone. The green faux leather back exudes luxury, and it's nice and slim. The cameras are solid, and the 6.8-inch LCD screen has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate and gets plenty bright. Best of all, the company retained the wireless charging it debuted in last year's model, making it one of the only sub-$300 phones with this convenience. Another area of improvement? It's IP68/69-rated, so you won't have to baby this phone near a pool; it can handle a dip just fine. Motorola has also extended software updates for the first time on the Moto G series, now promising two Android OS upgrades, with the same three years of security updates. That means you can hold on to this cheap phone for a little longer. There's a fair amount of bloatware, but you can remove most of these preinstalled apps. Specs Display: 6.8-inch, 120-Hz LCD Processor and RAM: MediaTek Dimensity 6300 with 8 GB RAM Storage: 128 GB Battery: 5,000 mAh Cameras: 50-MP main camera, 8-MP ultrawide, 16-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): Two OS upgrades, 3 years of security updates Extras: Wireless charging, IP68/69, fingerprint unlock, headphone jack, microSD Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks $300 at Amazon $300 at Best Buy $300 at Motorola Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Folding Android Phone (It’s Small!) Motorola Razr+ (2024) Note: Motorola will be revealing its next Razr phone on April 24 . I recommend holding off on the Razr+ (unless you see a great sale). Folding flip phones are the solution for folks who hate big-screen devices and want tiny things that can fit in the smallest pockets. The standout is the Razr+ 2024 ( 7/10, WIRED Recommends ). It has a large, 4-inch cover screen that lets you launch any app, scroll through widgets like a calendar and weather, and even play fun mini-games designed for the compact form. My favorite is the ability to see the camera preview on this screen, so you can take high-quality selfies and make sure everyone is in the shot. Open it up and you get a pretty normal Android phone experience with the 6.9-inch internal AMOLED display. Performance was more than satisfactory, even if this phone uses the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset, a slightly lesser version of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 found in other top-end Android phones. Battery life won't wow you—heavy users may have to top up before the day's end. But at least Motorola has improved its camera system thanks to a new image processing algorithm, though processing time does take a few more seconds than I'd like. Still, this is a well-performing flip phone and one of the only smartphones around that comes in hot pink . Specs External display: 4-inch, 165-Hz LTPO, pOLED Internal display: 6.9-inch, 165-Hz LTPO, AMOLED Processor and RAM: Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 with 12 GB RAM Storage: 256 GB Battery: 4,000 mAh Cameras: 50-MP main camera, 50-MP telephoto (2X), 32-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): Three OS upgrades, 4 years of security updates Extras: Wireless charging, IPX8, fingerprint unlock Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks $1,000 $759 at Amazon $1,000 $800 at Best Buy $1,000 $800 at Motorola Photograph: Julian Chokkattu A Unique and Fun Cheap Phone CMF Phone 1 Note: Nothing will reveal the CMF Phone 2 Pro on April 28 . Considering it's a “Pro” model, you can expect a higher price. I recommend holding off on the CMF Phone 1. CMF—a sub-brand from Nothing —delivered a remarkable smartphone for just $239 (originally launched at $199). Sure, you can swap out the back to a different color via the screws and the included screwdriver. And it has a fun system that lets you attach various accessories via the thumb screw on the back corner of the phone, like a lanyard, kickstand, or wallet. But this Accessory Point is just the cherry on top. What's impressive is the sheer hardware itself. The CMF Phone 1 ( 9/10, WIRED Recommends ) is the best-performing phone you'll find for the money, with a surprisingly good camera system and two-day battery life with average use. The screen gets decently bright and is sharp and smooth too. There are some caveats though. First, this phone is only available via a beta program in the US, so you'll need to sign up, and once accepted, you can purchase it. It also has spotty carrier compatibility. It'll work best on T-Mobile, and I had no issues on AT&T, but you might not get the best 5G coverage. CMF doesn't recommend you use it on Verizon. My only other gripe is the lack of NFC , meaning you can't tap to pay with this phone. Still, this is the best value in Android today. Specs Display: 6.67-inch, 120-Hz AMOLED Processor and RAM: MediaTek Dimensity 7300 with 8 GB RAM Storage: 128- and 256-GB options Battery: 5,000 mAh Cameras: 50-MP main camera and portrait sensor, 16-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): Two OS upgrades, 3 years of security updates Extras: IP52, fingerprint unlock, microSD, Accessory Point system Carrier compatibility: Works on T-Mobile and AT&T with spotty 5G coverage; not recommended on Verizon $239 at Nothing $289 $260 at Amazon (256 GB) Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Best Folding Phone Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold The Pixel 9 Pro Fold has some hardware differences from the flagship Pixel 9 Pro (despite both phones having “Pro” in their name, there are a few missing or lesser features on the Fold), but this is one of my favorite booklike folding phones at the moment ( 6/10, WIRED Recommends ). It's remarkably thin—so much so that you'll keep using the 6.3-inch external screen and forget that you have a folding device in your hands. Open it up and you get one of the largest inner displays available, and it's great for playing games and watching YouTube. It's also wonderful for split-screen apps, allowing you to juggle multiple tasks without feeling constrained by the size of your screen. This Pixel more or less has all the aforementioned smart software features as the Pixel 9 series, including the fun new camera features . You can read more in our Best Folding Phones and Best Pixel Phones buying guides. Specs External display: 6.3-inch, 120-Hz OLED Internal display: 8-inch, 120-Hz LTPO, OLED Processor and RAM: Tensor G4 with 16 GB RAM Storage: 256- and 512-GB options Battery: 4,650 mAh Cameras: 48-MP main camera, 10.5-MP 5X telephoto, 10.5-MP ultrawide, 10-MP front camera, 10-MP inner selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): 7 years of software updates Extras: Wireless charging, IPX8, fingerprint and secure face unlock, NFC Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks $1,799 at Amazon $1,799 at Best Buy $1,799 at Google Store Photograph: Simon Hill If You’re Outside the US Honor Magic 7 Pro If you're outside the US , you have a wealth of smartphone options at various prices. It's enviable! Our current standout recommendation is the Honor Magic 7 Pro ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ), which my colleague Simon Hill says is “nearly flawless.” This is a high-end phone through and through, mimicking the OnePlus 13 in a lot of ways with a silicon-carbon battery, Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and the ability to recharge from zero to 100 in 33 minutes. Even the triple-camera system is reliable and versatile. There's a raft of AI features, but it's difficult to say how useful they are. Thankfully, Honor has made a special effort to polish the overall software experience, and it shows. Specs Display: 6.8-inch, 120-Hz LTPO, OLED Processor and RAM: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite with 12 GB RAM Storage: 256-GB, 512-GB, 1-TB options Battery: 5,270 mAh Cameras: 50-MP main camera, 50-MP ultrawide, 200-MP telephoto (3X), 50-MP selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): Five years of software updates Extras: IP68/69, fingerprint unlock, secure face unlock, NFC, fast charging with proprietary charger Carrier compatibility: Not fully compatible with US carriers $999 at Giztop $859 at Wonda Mobile Other Phones to Consider Photograph: Julian Chokkattu We test a ton of Android phones. We like the ones below, but you'll be better off with one of the options above. If you haven't yet done so, check out our Best Cheap Phones and Best Folding Phones guides for more. Google Pixel 9 for $649 : The Pixel 9 is a great smartphone ( 9/10, WIRED Recommends ), but between the Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 Pro series, it struggles to stand out. It shares many features with its pricier siblings, but you can get a very similar experience with the Pixel 9a, all while saving hundreds of dollars. If you love the design and want the new smart software features, don't let me stop you! Samsung Galaxy S24 FE for $650 : Samsung's Galaxy S24 FE is a better buy now that the flagship Galaxy S24 series is harder to find for sale. It's a perfectly capable smartphone with a triple-camera array (including a 3X telephoto camera), and it delivers good performance. It has wireless charging, is IP68 water resistant, and has solid day-long battery life. It's a shame the design’s a bit drab. Alternatively, you can try to find the flagship Galaxy S24 series on sale: the Galaxy S24 , Galaxy S24+ , and Galaxy S24 Ultra are still excellent devices, but make sure you don't spend anywhere near their MSRP. Google Pixel 8a for $487 : The Pixel 8A ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ) isn't too dissimilar from the latest Pixel 9a. It looks gorgeous (especially in the flashy Aloe color), has a powerful processor—Tensor G3—and nearly all the same smart software features that make Pixels a joy to use. The 64-MP camera and a 13-MP ultrawide capture better photos than most midrange phones, and you get a compact 6.1-inch OLED screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate to boot. Make sure you don't pay more than $399 for one. If it's close to $499, just buy the newer Pixel 9a. ROG Phone 9 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Asus ROG Phone 9 for $1,000 : The ROG phone series is for serious gamers. There are two USB-C ports, so you can charge the phone comfortably even while using it in landscape mode for gaming. It has perks like a headphone jack and a bevy of accessories you can attach, like a cooler and a mobile controller, to enhance the gaming experience. Unfortunately, other aspects of this phone struggle to match the high price—the software can feel clunky, and the cameras are not at all what you'd expect at this price level. I also ran into a few annoying bugs while using the Phone 9 Pro . Google Pixel 8 for $489~ and Pixel 8 Pro for $599~ : The Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro ( 7/10, WIRED Recommends ) from 2023 are still available to buy, and they're great devices with lots of life left in them. Just make sure you don't spend more than $600. (Prices constantly fluctuate.) Anything more, and you should just buy from the new Pixel 9 series. Honor Magic V3 for £1,700 : If you're outside the US, the Magic V3 might be the best folding phone right now; it's certainly the world's thinnest folding phone ( 8/10, WIRED Recommends ). It has great battery life, a wide external screen that feels like a normal phone, and an expansive inner screen when unfolded. Even the cameras are versatile, though the ultrawide isn't great, and the phone's overall software can induce some annoyances. Photograph: Julian Chokkattu Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 for $1,900 : The Fold6 ( 7/10, WIRED Recommends ) is an excellent big-screen folding smartphone. If you're worried about durability and repairability when purchasing a fold, Samsung is your best bet, as it has been producing these devices for the longest time. The cameras snap great photos, the displays get shockingly bright, and Samsung promises lengthy software support. The Fold6's exterior screen is slightly wider and much nicer to use than previous iterations, but otherwise, there are not a ton of new changes outside of AI advancements. You can still snag 2023's Galaxy Z Fold5 to save some dough. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip6 for $1,100 : The Flip6 ( 7/10, WIRED Recommends ) has some perks over Motorola's new Razr+, like a nicer hinge mechanism, better build quality, stronger cameras, and longer software support. But I still preferred the overall experience on Motorola's flip, mostly due to the larger external screen. Still, the Flip6's 3.4-inch cover screen is handy for glancing through widgets, and you can open it up to get a big-screen Android phone experience. The Galaxy Z Flip5 is a worthy option if you don't mind buying 2023 tech at a lower price. Mobile Accessories You Might Need Photograph: Julian Chokkattu We have case recommendations for a few popular devices, like Samsung's Galaxy S25 , Galaxy S24 , and Galaxy S23, or Google's Pixel 9 series . It's smart to slap a case on these glass sandwiches and even a screen protector to keep the display free of scuffs and scratches. Here are a few other noteworthy accessories, including charging adapters, which many phones don't include anymore . Read our Best USB-C Cables guide for other recommendations. Anker 45-Watt Charger for $28 : This tiny charger will be enough for most people to charge most smartphones. It's compact, reliable, and cheap, plus the prongs fold up. More smartphones than ever can go up to 45-watt charging speeds, so take advantage with a 45-watt charger. Counterpart Retractable The Charger for $44 : It's not the best value, but this design-forward charger has a retractable 4-foot cable that makes it a fantastic two-in-one—no need to pack a separate charger and cable! It outputs 35 watts, which is plenty to fast-charge most phones and tablets, and the prongs fold in for travel. Peak Design Samsung and Pixel Everyday Case for $50 : If you have a Samsung or Pixel phone and you frequently mount your phone to a bike or scooter, you owe it to yourself to snag this case and Peak Design's bike mount . The case snaps perfectly into the mount, is dead simple to release, and has yet to fall off after years of riding. Peak Design also sells several other accessories you can attach to the back of these cases, bringing Android into Apple's MagSafe ecosystem . Nimble Champ Portable Charger 10,000 mAh for $60 : This portable battery is small enough to leave in a bag but has enough power to fully recharge your phone once or twice. There's a USB-C and USB-A port, it delivers 18 watts of power, so it can recharge your tablet or phone, and it's housed in 73 percent post-consumer plastic with plastic-free packaging. Nomad ChargeKey V2 for $25 : When your phone dies, it's almost always when you forget to bring a charger or battery pack. The ChargeKey is a nifty solution—it's like clipping a tiny USB-C charging cable to your keychain. Just plug one end into your phone and the other into any kind of power source (a friend's phone or a charging adapter if you manage to find one), and you can top up your phone. Native Union also has a similar item that's cuter but nearly as capable. Choose a Wireless Charger : Our guide to the best wireless chargers includes dozens of models in varying colors, shapes, and materials, and even some designed for specific phones. Not every Android phone supports wireless charging, but it's a luxury you'll want to take advantage of. Take a gander at our guide for our favorites.
